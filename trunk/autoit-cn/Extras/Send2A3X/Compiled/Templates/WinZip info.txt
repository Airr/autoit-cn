Unattended Installs

/Autoinstall and Other Installation Options

Unattended installs can be managed by packages like Microsoft's System Management Server (SMS). This involves the following steps:

Network Administrator One-Time-Only Setup: follow the instructions on the customized WinZip distribution CD to install WinZip. When prompted for a destination folder, specify a location on a network disk (for example, n:\winzip). If you do not have a customized distribution CD and are using the downloaded distribution file, then run the distribution file (winzip100.exe) and install WinZip to a network location available to all your users. Then copy the multi-user license, winzip.wzmul, to the same location.

User Setup (repeated for each user account, usually by a software robot): (Note: the presence of the winzip.wzmul file in the WinZip program files folder facilitates an, automatic installation of WinZip with default installation settings, using the Classic interface, as if the user had manually selected the "Express Install" option, each time WinZip 10.0 (WINZIP32.EXE) is run the first time under an account. The default installation settings include the creation of a program group, desktop and start menu shortcuts, addition of the Quick Pick tray icon to the startup folder, and WinZip file associations for all users, among other things.

To install WinZip 'silently', without opening its main window, run winzip32.exe from the folder specified by the network administrator, specifying the /autoinstall switch on the command line. Using the example folder above, the command would be 
n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /autoinstall

Alternatively, you may use either the /autoinstall or /autoinstallrun switch in combination with other parameters to customize your installation. /autoinstallrun is the same as /autoinstall, except that /autoinstallrun opens the WinZip window after the silent installation completes.
You may also specify switches to:


prevent WinZip from including the WinZip Quick Pick icon in the taskbar tray

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /noqp /autoinstall 
prevent the "Check for Update" function from running

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /noc4u /autoinstall 
prevent the "Tip of the Day" from displaying 

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /notip /autoinstall 
prevent the pre-configured WinZip jobs from being installed

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /nopredefinedjobs /autoinstall 
prevent the prompt dialog from appearing when running WinZip jobs **

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /nojobrunprompt /autoinstall 
prevent WinZip from including the WinZip icon on the desktop

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /nodesktop /autoinstall 
prevent WinZip from including the WinZip icon at the top of the Start menu

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /nostartmenu /autoinstall 
prevent WinZip from creating a WinZip program group and icons

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /nomenugroup /autoinstall 
You may use any combination or all of the switches. (Please note that when using multiple switches, they must be in the order displayed in this example.

n:\winzip\winzip32.exe /noqp /noc4u /notip /nopredefinedjobs /nojobrunprompt /nodesktop /nostartmenu /nomenugroup /autoinstall 
**Be sure to consider the security implications of allowing your users to automatically run WinZip Job files before installing with this parameter.

Local Copies of the WinZip Files: If you would prefer your workstations to have local copies of WinZip instead of running WinZip from a network, first copy the WinZip folder and all its files to the local machine. Then run the copy of WinZip on the local machine with the chosen command line switches (for example, /autoinstall).

###Remarks###
After running the requested program the script pauses until the program terminates.  To run a program and then immediately continue script execution use the Run function instead.

Some programs will appear to return immediately even though they are still running; these programs spawn another process - you may be able to use the ProcessWaitClose function to handle these cases.

The <b>error<b> property is set to 1 as an indication of failure.

If the button is an empty string, the left button will be clicked.

If the button is not in the list, then oAutoIt.error will be set to 1.

If the user has swapped the left and right mouse buttons in the control panel, then the behaviour of the buttons is different.  "Left" and "right" always click those buttons, whether the buttons are swapped or not.  The "primary" or "main" button will be the main click, whether or not the buttons are swapped.  The "secondary" or "menu" buttons will usually bring up the context menu, whether the buttons are swapped or not.

The "Send" command syntax is similar to that of ScriptIt and the Visual Basic "SendKeys" command. Characters are sent as written with the exception of the following characters:

'!'
This tells AutoIt to send an ALT keystroke, therefore Send("This is text!a") would send the keys "This is text" and then press "ALT+a".

N.B. Some programs are very choosy about capital letters and ALT keys, i.e. "!A" is different to "!a". The first says ALT+SHIFT+A, the second is ALT+a. If in doubt, use lowercase!

'+'
This tells AutoIt to send a SHIFT keystroke, therefore Send("Hell+o") would send the text "HellO". Send("!+a") would send "ALT+SHIFT+a".

'^'
This tells AutoIt to send a CONTROL keystroke, therefore Send("^!a") would send "CTRL+ALT+a".

N.B. Some programs are very choosy about capital letters and CTRL keys, i.e. "^A" is different to "^a". The first says CTRL+SHIFT+A, the second is CTRL+a.  If in doubt, use lowercase!

'#'
The hash now sends a Windows keystroke; therefore, Send("#r") would send Win+r which launches the Run dialog box.


You can set SendCapslockMode to make CAPS LOCK disabled at the start of a Send operation and restored upon completion.
However, if a user is holding down the Shift key when a Send function begins, text may be sent in uppercase.
One workaround is to Send("{SHIFTDOWN}{SHIFTUP}")  before the other Send operations.


Certain special keys can be sent and should be enclosed in braces:

N.B.  Windows does not allow the simulation of the "CTRL-ALT-DEL" combination!

To send the ASCII value A (same as pressing ALT+065 on the numeric keypad)
	Send("{ASC 65}")

Single keys can also be repeated, e.g.
	Send("{DEL 4}")    ;Presses the DEL key 4 times
	Send("{S 30}")      ;Sends 30 'S' characters
	Send("+{TAB 4})   ;Presses SHIFT+TAB 4 times

To hold a key down (generally only useful for games)
	Send("{a down}")    ;Holds the A key down
	Send("{a up}")        ;Releases the A key

To set the state of the capslock, numlock and scrolllock keys
	Send("{NumLock on}")        ;Turns the NumLock key on
	Send("{CapsLock off}")      ;Turns the CapsLock key off
	Send("{ScrollLock toggle}") ;Toggles the state of ScrollLock

If you with to use a variable for the count, try
	$n = 4
	Send("+{TAB " & $n & "}")

If you wish to send the ASCII value A four times, then try
	$x = Chr(65)
	Send("{" & $x & " 4}")

Most laptop computer keyboards have a special Fn key.  This key cannot be simulated.

Note, by setting the flag parameter to 1 the above "special" processing will be disabled.  This is useful when you want to send some text copied from a variable and you want the text sent exactly as written.


For example, open Folder Options (in the control panel) and try the following:

Send("{TAB}")	Navigate to next control (button, checkbox, etc)
Send("+{TAB}")	Navigate to previous control.
Send("^{TAB}")	Navigate to next WindowTab (on a Tabbed dialog window)
Send("^+{TAB}")	Navigate to previous WindowTab.
Send("{SPACE}")	Can be used to toggle a checkbox or click a button.
Send("{+}")	Usually checks a checkbox (if it's a "real" checkbox.)
Send("{-}")	Usually unchecks a checkbox.
Send("{NumPadMult}")	Recursively expands folders in a SysTreeView32.

###Method###
ProcessWait

###Description###
Pauses script execution until a given process exists.

###Syntax###
ProcessWait "process" [, timeout]


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
process
	The name of the process to check.
timeout
	<b>Optional:</b> Specifies how long to wait (default is to wait indefinitely).
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
Success:  Returns 1.
Failure:  Returns 0 if the wait timed out.


###Remarks###
Process names are executables without the full path, e.g., "notepad.exe" or "winword.exe"
In order to work under Windows NT 4.0, ProcessWait requires the file PSAPI.DLL (included in the AutoIt installation directory).
The process is polled approximately every 250 milliseconds.

This function is the only process function not to accept a PID.  Because PIDs are allocated randomly, waiting for a particular PID to exist doesn't make sense.


###Related###
ProcessClose, ProcessExists, ProcessWaitClose, RunWait, WinWait, WinWaitActive


###Example###
Set oAutoIt = WScript.CreateObject("AutoItX3.Control")
oAutoIt.ProcessWait "notepad.exe"

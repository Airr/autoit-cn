###Keyword###
ContinueCase

###Description###
Abort the code in the current Case block and continue with the code in the next Case block when in a Select or Switch structure.

###Syntax###
<strong>ContinueCase</strong>


###Parameters###
None.

###Remarks###
Normally in a Select or Switch structure, the code within each Case block ends when the next Case statement is encountered. Executing <a href="ContinueCase.htm">ContinueCase</a> tells AutoIt to stop executing the code within the current Case block and start executing the code within the next Case block.  AutoIt does not evaluate the next Case comparison statement - only the code inside the block is run.

Trying to execute <a href="ContinueCase.htm">ContinueCase</a> outside of a Select or Switch will cause a fatal error.

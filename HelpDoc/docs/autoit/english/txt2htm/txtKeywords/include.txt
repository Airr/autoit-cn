###Keyword###
#include

###Description###
Includes a file in the current script.

###Syntax###
<b>#include</b> "[path\]filename"
<b>#include</b> &lt;filename&gt;


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
filename
	The filename of the current script to include. Path is optional. <b>This must be a string--it cannot be a variable.</b>
	If <b>"..."</b> is used, the filename is taken to be relative to the current script.
	If <b>&lt;...&gt;</b> is used the filename is taken to be relative to include library directory (usually C:\Program Files\AutoIt3\Include). The include library contains many pre-written user-functions for you to use!
	@@End@@

###Remarks###
In an AutoIt script, other scripts can be included using the #include" command.

If you include the same file containing a user-function more than once you will get a "Duplicate function" error. When writing an include file that may be used in this way, make sure that the top line contains <b>#include-once</b> to prevent that file from being included more than once.

There is a special registry value that can be created at "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AutoIt v3\AutoIt" called "Include". It should be a REG_SZ (string) value. The contents of this value are a semi-colon delimited list of directories that should be searched for files when resolving #include's in addition to the standard locations.

The search order used by AutoIt depends on which form of #include you use. The tables below show the order directories are searched using both forms.

Using #include <>

Standard library
	The path of the currently running interpreter with "\Include" appended is searched.
User-defined libraries
	The registry value mentioned above is read and each directory is searched in the order they appear in.
Script directory
	The directory of the currently executing script.

Using #include "" (This is the reverse of #include <>).
@@ParamTable@@
Script directory
	The directory of the currently executing script.
User-defined libraries
	The registry value mentioned above is read and each directory is searched in the reverse order they appear in.
Standard library
	The path of the currently running interpreter with "\Include" appended is searched.
@@End@@

A note about using the /AutoIt3ExecuteScript option. Since the standard library is searched for in the current interpreter's directory, the standard library functions will not be found; that library will only be found when run through AutoIt3.exe. It's recommended that you compile a script to the .a3x format before attempting to run it with /AutoIt3ExecuteScript.

Aut2Exe uses the same algorithm as AutoIt3.exe with the only difference being it looks for the Include sub-directory as being in a sibling directory to itself (..\Include).

If Opt("TrayIconDebug",1) only 64 include files name can be displayed in the traytooltip. for the other no filename will be displayed.

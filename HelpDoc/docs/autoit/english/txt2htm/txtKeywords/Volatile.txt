###Keyword###
Volatile

###Experimental###

###Description###
Function qualifier.

###Syntax###
	<b>Volatile</b> Func functioname(...)
	...
	EndFunc


###Parameters###
None.

###Remarks###
Use <b>Volatile</b> qualifier to modify certain aspects of function execution.

The following rules apply to functions that are declared with this qualifier:
@@ParamTable@@
Callback function
	During function execution the main AutoIt's message pump is not blocked as it normally is for non-Volatile callbacks.
COM event function
	The execution is synchronous (see example).
@@End@@

SetTimer callbacks are not safe as Volatile so be sure to avoid them.
For all other cases there is no difference in execution of Volatile functions compared to <i>regular</i> functions.

###Remarks###
GetWindowDC is intended for special painting effects within a window's nonclient area. Painting in nonclient
areas of any window is normally not recommended. The GetSystemMetrics function can be used to retrieve the
dimensions of various parts of the nonclient area, such as the title bar, menu, and scroll bars. After
painting is complete, the <a href="_WinAPI_ReleaseDC.htm">_WinAPI_ReleaseDC()</a> function must be called to release the device context. Not releasing
the window device context has serious effects on painting requested by applications.

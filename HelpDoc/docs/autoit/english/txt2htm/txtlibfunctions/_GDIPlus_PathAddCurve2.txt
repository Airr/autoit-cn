###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathAddCurve2

###Description###
Adds a cardinal spline to the current figure of a path

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathAddCurve2 ( $hPath, $aPoints [, $fTension = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hPath
	Pointer to a GraphicsPath object
$aPoints
	Array of points that define the cardinal spline:
		[0][0] - Number of points
		[1][0] - Point 1 X position
		[1][1] - Point 1 Y position
		[2][0] - Point 2 X position
		[2][1] - Point 2 Y position
		[n][0] - Point n X position
		[n][1] - Point n Y position
$fTension
	[optional] Nonnegative real number that controls the length of the curve and how the curve bends.
	A value of 0 specifies that the spline is a sequence of straight lines.
	As the value increases, the curve becomes fuller.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	True.
Failure:	False and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended may contain GPSTATUS error code ($GPID_ERR*).
@@End@@


###Remarks###
A cardinal spline is a curve that passes through each point in the array.

###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_BitBlt

###Description###
Performs a bit-block transfer of color data

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPI.au3>
_WinAPI_BitBlt ( $hDestDC, $iXDest, $iYDest, $iWidth, $iHeight, $hSrcDC, $iXSrc, $iYSrc, $iROP )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDestDC
	Handle to the destination device context
$iXDest
	X value of the upper-left corner of the destination rectangle
$iYDest
	Y value of the upper-left corner of the destination rectangle
$iWidth
	Width of the source and destination rectangles
$iHeight
	Height of the source and destination rectangles
$hSrcDC
	Handle to the source device context
$iXSrc
	X value of the upper-left corner of the source rectangle
$iYSrc
	Y value of the upper-left corner of the source rectangle
$iROP
	Specifies a raster operation code. These codes define how the color data for the source
	rectangle is to be combined with the color data for the destination rectangle to achieve the final color:
	$BLACKNESS - Fills the destination rectangle using the color associated with palette index 0
	$CAPTUREBLT - Includes any window that are layered on top of your window in the resulting image
	$DSTINVERT - Inverts the destination rectangle
	$MERGECOPY - Merges the color of the source rectangle with the brush currently selected in hDest, by
	using the AND operator.
	$MERGEPAINT - Merges the color of the inverted source rectangle with the colors of the destination
	rectangle by using the OR operator.
	$NOMIRRORBITMAP - Prevents the bitmap from being mirrored
	$NOTSRCCOPY - Copies the inverted source rectangle to the destination
	$NOTSRCERASE - Combines the colors of the source and destination rectangles by using the OR operator and
	then inverts the resultant color.
	$PATCOPY - Copies the brush selected in hdcDest, into the destination bitmap
	$PATINVERT - Combines the colors of the brush currently selected in hDest, with the colors of the
	destination rectangle by using the XOR operator.
	$PATPAINT - Combines the colors of the brush currently selected in hDest, with the colors of the
	inverted source rectangle by using the OR operator. The result of this operation is combined with the color
	of the destination rectangle by using the OR operator.
	$SRCAND - Combines the colors of the source and destination rectangles by using the AND operator
	$SRCCOPY - Copies the source rectangle directly to the destination rectangle
	$SRCERASE - Combines the inverted color of the destination rectangle with the colors of the source
	rectangle by using the AND operator.
	$SRCINVERT - Combines the colors of the source and destination rectangles by using the XOR operator
	$SRCPAINT - Combines the colors of the source and destination rectangles by using the OR operator
	$WHITENESS - Fills the destination rectangle using the color associated with index 1 in the physical
	palette.

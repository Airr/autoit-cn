###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to the control
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
Returns an Value of the callback mask. The bits of the mask indicate the item states or images for which
	the application stores the current state data. This value can be any combination of the following:		 1 - The item is marked for a cut-and-paste operation
	2 - The item is highlighted as a drag-and-drop target
	4 - The item has the focus
	8 - The item is selected
	16 - The application stores the image list index of the current overlay image
	32 - The application stores the image list index of the current state image


###Remarks###
The callback mask is a set of bit flags that specify the item states for which the application, rather than
the control, stores the current data.

The callback mask applies to all of the control's items, unlike the callback item designation, which applies
to a specific item. The callback mask is zero by default, meaning that the control stores all item state
information.

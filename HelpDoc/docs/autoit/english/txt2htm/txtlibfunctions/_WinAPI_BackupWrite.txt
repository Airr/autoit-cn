###Description###
Restore a file or directory that was backed up using _WinAPI_BackupRead()

_WinAPI_BackupWrite ( $hFile, $pBuffer, $iLength, ByRef $iBytes, ByRef $pContext [, $fSecurity = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hFile
	Handle to the file or directory to be restored. To obtain the handle, call the <a href="_WinAPI_CreateFileEx.htm">_WinAPI_CreateFileEx()</a> function.
	The SACLs are not restored unless the file handle was created with the $ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY access right.
	To ensure that the integrity ACEs are restored correctly, the file handle must also have been created with the $WRITE_OWNER access right.
$pBuffer
	A pointer to a buffer that the function writes data from.
$iLength
	The size of the buffer, in bytes. The buffer size must be greater than the size of the $tagWIN32_STREAM_ID structure.
	(see MSDN for more information)
$iBytes
	The number of bytes written.
$pContext
	A pointer to an internal data structure used by this function to maintain context information during a restore operation.
	You must set this variable to 0 before the first call to <a href="_WinAPI_BackupWrite.htm">_WinAPI_BackupWrite()</a> for the specified file or directory.
	The function allocates memory for the data structure, and then sets the variable to point to that structure.
	You must not change this variable or the variable that it points to between calls to <a href="_WinAPI_BackupWrite.htm">_WinAPI_BackupWrite()</a>.
$fSecurity
	[optional] Specifies whether the function will restore the access-control list (ACL) data, valid values:
	True      - The ACL data will be restored.
	Furthermore, you need to specify $WRITE_OWNER and $WRITE_DAC access when opening the file or directory handle.
	If the handle does not have those access rights, the operating system denies access to the ACL data, and ACL data restoration will not occur.
	False     - The ACL data will be omitted (Default).

When you are done using <a href="_WinAPI_BackupWrite.htm">_WinAPI_BackupWrite()</a>, you must call <a href="_WinAPI_BackupWriteAbort.htm">_WinAPI_BackupWriteAbort()</a> function with the appropriate parameter to release the memory used by the internal data structure.

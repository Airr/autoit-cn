###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathWarp

###Description###
Applies a warp transformation to a path. The function also flattens (converts to a sequence of straight lines) the path

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathWarp ( $hPath, $hMatrix, $aPoints, $iX, $iY, $iWidth, $iHeight [, $iWarpMode = 0 [, $fFlatness = 0.25]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hPath
	Pointer to a GraphicsPath object
$hMatrix
	Pointer to a Matrix object that represents a transformation to be applied along with the warp.
$aPoints
	Array of parallelogram points that, along with the rectangle parameters, define the wrap mode:
		[0][0] - Number of points. This number must be 3 or 4
		[1][0] - Point 1 X coordinate
		[1][1] - Point 1 Y coordinate
		[2][0] - Point 2 X coordinate
		[2][1] - Point 2 Y coordinate
		[n][0] - Point n X coordinate
		[n][1] - Point n Y coordinate
$iX
	X coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle to be transformed into a parallelogram defined by $aPoints
$iY
	Y coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle to be transformed into a parallelogram defined by $aPoints
$iWidth
	Width of the rectangle to be transformed into a parallelogram defined by $aPoints
$iHeight
	Height of the rectangle to be transformed into a parallelogram defined by $aPoints
$iWarpMode
	[optional] Kind of warp to be applied:
		0 - Specifies the perspective warp mode
		1 - Specifies the bilinear warp mode
$fFlatness
	[optional] Real number that influences the number of line segments that are used to approximate the original path.
	Small values specify that many line segments are used, and large values specify that few line segments are used.

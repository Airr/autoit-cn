###User Defined Function###
_NamedPipes_ConnectNamedPipe

###Description###
Enables a named pipe server process to wait for a client process to connect

###Syntax###
#include <NamedPipes.au3>
_NamedPipes_ConnectNamedPipe ( $hNamedPipe [, $pOverlapped = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hNamedPipe
	Handle to the server end of a named pipe instance
$pOverlapped
	[optional] Pointer to a $tagOVERLAPPED structure.
		If hNamedPipe was opened with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, pOverlapped must not be 0.
		If hNamedPipe was created with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and pOverlapped is not 0, the $tagOVERLAPPED structure should contain a handle to a manual reset event object.
		If hNamedPipe was not opened with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, the function does not return until a client is connected or an error occurs.
	Successful synchronous operations result in the function returning a nonzero value if a client connects after the function is called.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	True.
Failure:	False.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If a client connects before the function is called, the function returns zero and GetLastError will return ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED.
This can happen if a client connects in the interval between the call to CreateNamedPipe and the call to ConnectNamedPipe.
In this situation, there is a good connection between client and server even though the function returns zero.

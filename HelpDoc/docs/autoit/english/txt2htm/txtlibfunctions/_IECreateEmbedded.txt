###Remarks###
No actions can be performed on this object until it has been embedded into a parent application (e.g. you cannot perform an <a href="_IENavigate.htm">_IENavigate()</a>.
Because of this restriction, the browser is not automatically navigated to 'about:blank' as is a browser created with <a href="_IECreate.htm">_IECreate()</a>.
You must therefore use <a href="_IENavigate.htm">_IENavigate()</a> to navigate this browser to 'about:blank' after it has been embedded into the parent application and before you attempt any operations that rely on having a document loaded (e.g. <a href="_IEBodyWriteHTML.htm">_IEBodyWriteHTML()</a>
 ).

There are several properties related to an InternetExplorer object (e.g. returned by <a href="_IECreate.htm">_IECreate()</a> ) that do not apply to this object.
These include status text, addressbar and others that may exist for a browser, but do not exist for an embedded control.

You may have object visibility issues unless you use the Windows style $WS_CLIPCHILDREN in <a href="../functions/GUICreate.htm">GUICreate()</a>.

<a href="_IEQuit.htm">_IEQuit()</a> cannot be used with this object.  The object will be destroyed when its parent GUI is destroyed.

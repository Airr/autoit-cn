_WinAPI_AddFontMemResourceEx ( $pData, $iSize )

@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	The handle uniquely identifies the fonts that were installed on the system,
	@extended flag will contain a number of fonts added to the system as a result of this call.
Failure:	0.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
This function allows an application to get a font that is embedded in a document or a Web page.
A font that is added by this is always private to the process that made the call and is not enumerable.

When the function succeeds, the caller of this function can free the memory pointed to by $pData because the system has made its own copy of the memory.
To remove the fonts that were installed, call <a href="_WinAPI_RemoveFontMemResourceEx.htm">_WinAPI_RemoveFontMemResourceEx()</a>.
However, when the process goes away, the system will unload the fonts.

###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathWiden

###Description###
Replaces a path with curves that enclose the area that is filled when the path is drawn by a specified pen. The function also flattens the path

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathWiden ( $hPath, $hPen [, $hMatrix = 0 [, $fFlatness = 0.25]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hPath
	Pointer to a GraphicsPath object
$hPen
	Pointer to a Pen object. The path is made as wide as it would be when drawn by this pen. If 0, a solid black pen with a width of 1 will be used
$hMatrix
	[optional] Pointer to a Matrix object that represents a transformation to be applied along with the widening. If 0, no transformation is applied
$fFlatness
	[optional] Real number that specifies the maximum error between the path and its flattened approximation.
	Reducing the flatness increases the number of line segments in the approximation

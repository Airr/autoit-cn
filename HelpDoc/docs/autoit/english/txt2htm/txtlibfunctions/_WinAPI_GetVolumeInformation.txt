###Remarks###
When a user attempts to get information about a floppy drive that does not have a floppy disk, or a CD-ROM
drive that does not have a compact disc, the system displays a message box for the user to insert a floppy disk
or a compact disc, respectively. To prevent the system from displaying this message box, call the
_WinAPI_SetErrorMode() function with $SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS.

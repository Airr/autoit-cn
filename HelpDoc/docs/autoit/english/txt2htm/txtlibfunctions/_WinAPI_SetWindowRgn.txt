###Remarks###
The window region determines the area within the window where the system permits drawing.
The system does not display any portion of a window that lies outside of the window region
When this function is called, the system sends the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING and WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED messages to the window.
The coordinates of a window's window region are relative to the upper-left corner of the window, not the client area of the window.
After a successful call to SetWindowRgn, the system owns the region specified by the region handle $hRgn.
The system does not make a copy of the region. Thus, you should not make any further function calls with this region handle.
In particular, do not delete this region handle. The system deletes the region handle when it no longer needed.

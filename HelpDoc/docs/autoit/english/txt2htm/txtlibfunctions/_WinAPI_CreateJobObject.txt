###Remarks###
When a job is created, its accounting information is initialized to zero, all limits are inactive, and there are no associated processes. To assign a process to a job object, use the <a href="_WinAPI_AssignProcessToJobObject.htm">_WinAPI_AssignProcessToJobObject()</a> function.
To set limits for a job, use the <a href="_WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject.htm">_WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject()</a> function.
To query accounting information, use the <a href="_WinAPI_QueryInformationJobObject.htm">_WinAPI_QueryInformationJobObject()</a> function.

All processes associated with a job must run in the same session. A job is associated with the session of the first process to be assigned to the job.

To close a job object handle, use the <a href="_WinAPI_CloseHandle.htm">_WinAPI_CloseHandle()</a> function. The job is destroyed when its last handle has been closed and all associated processes have exited.

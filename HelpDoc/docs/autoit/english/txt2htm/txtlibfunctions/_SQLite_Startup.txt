@@ParamTable@@
$sDll_Filename
	[optional] DLL filename. Default is "sqlite3.dll" or "sqlite3_x64.dll" in X64 mode.
$bUTF8ErrorMsg
	[optional] to force <a href="../functions/ConsoleWrite.htm">ConsoleWrite()</a> to display UTF8 chars
$iForceLocal
	[optional] 1 = use a the defined DLL file. No version checking. Automatic "_x64.dll" in X64 mode.
	0 = the DLL will be downloaded if not found in  @ScriptDir, @SystemDir, @WindowsDir or @WorkingDir.
	-1 = force download

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	the path to the opened DLL file.
Failure:	sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If #include <SQLite.dll.au3> is included the SQLite version is checked. If older, download will occur.

The downloaded file will be created in @SystemDir (may need #RequireAdmin).
If the creation is not successfull a temporary file will be created which will be destroyed at <a href="_SQLite_Shutdown.htm">_SQLite_Shutdown()</a>.

If $bUTF8ErrorMsg is not zero prints UTF8 formated string prints to console.
This allows applications as SciTE to display those characters if configured with output.code.page=65001.
This is the case when running SciTE under a non-english version as Vista(fr).

The $hPrintCallback parameter specifies the name of user-defined callback function. This function will be passed a single parameter which is the message to display.  The default callback function is __SQLite_ConsoleWrite().  See that function for an example of how to implement your own callback function.

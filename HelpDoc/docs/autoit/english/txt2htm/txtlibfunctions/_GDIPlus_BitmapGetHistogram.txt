###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_BitmapGetHistogram

###Description###
Returns one or more histograms for specified color channels of the specified Bitmap

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_BitmapGetHistogram ( $hBitmap, $iHistogramFormat, $iHistogramSize, $tChannel_0 [, $tChannel_1 = 0 [, $tChannel_2 = 0 [, $tChannel_3 = 0]]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hBitmap
	Handle to a Bitmap to which the effect is applied.
$iHistogramFormat
	HistogramFormat constant that specifies the channels for which histograms will be created ($GDIP_HistogramFormat*).
$iHistogramSize
	Number of elements in each of the arrays pointed to by $tChannel_0, $tChannel_1, $tChannel_2, and $tChannel_3?
$tChannel_0
	A DLL struct array of UINTs that receives the first histogram.
$tChannel_1
	[optional] A DLL struct array of UINTs that receives the second histogram if there is a second histogram.
	Pass NULL if there is no second histogram.
$tChannel_2
	[optional] A DLL struct array of UINTs that receives the third histogram if there is a third histogram.
	Pass NULL if there is no third histogram.
$tChannel_3
	[optional] A DLL struct array of UINTs that receives the fourth histogram if there is a fourth histogram.
	Pass NULL if there is no fourth histogram.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	True.
Failure:	False and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended may contain GPSTATUS error code ($GPID_ERR*).
@error:	-1 - GDIPlus.dll does not support this function.
	10 - Invalid parameters.

###Remarks###
The number of histograms returned depends on the $iHistogramFormat parameter. For example, if format is equal to $GDIP_HistogramFormatRGB, then three histograms are returned: one each for the red, green, and blue channels. In that case, $tChannel_0 receives the red-channel histogram, $tChannel_1 receives the green-channel histogram, and $tChannel_2 receives the blue-channel histogram. For $GDIP_HistogramFormatRGB, $tChannel_3 must be set to NULL because there is no fourth histogram

###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathFlatten

###Description###
Applies a transformation to a path and converts each curve in the path to a sequence of connected lines

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathFlatten ( $hPath [, $fFlatness = 0.25 [, $hMatrix = 0]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hPath
	Pointer to a GraphicsPath object
$fFlatness
	[optional] Real number that specifies the maximum error between the path and its flattened approximation.
	Reducing the flatness increases the number of line segments in the approximation
$hMatrix
	[optional] Pointer to a Matrix object that specifies the transformation to be applied to the path's data points

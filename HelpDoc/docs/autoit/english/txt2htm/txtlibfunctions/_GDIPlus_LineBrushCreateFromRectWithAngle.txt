###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_LineBrushCreateFromRectWithAngle

###Description###
Creates a LinearGradientBrush object from a rectangle, boundary colors and angle of direction

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_LineBrushCreateFromRectWithAngle ( $tRectF, $iARGBClr1, $iARGBClr2, $fAngle [, $bIsAngleScalable = True [, $iWrapMode = 0]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$tRectF
	$tagGDIPRECTF that specifies the starting and ending points of the gradient
$iARGBClr1
	Alpha, Red, Green and Blue components of the starting color of the line
$iARGBClr2
	Alpha, Red, Green and Blue components of the ending color of the line
$fAngle
	Depending the value of $fIsAngleScalable, this is the angle, in degrees (see remarks)
$bIsAngleScalable
	[optional] If True, the angle of the directional line is scalable. Not scalable otherwise
$iWrapMode
	[optional] Specifies how areas filled with the brush are tiled:
		0 - Tiling without flipping
		1 - Tiles are flipped horizontally as you move from one tile to the next in a row
		2 - Tiles are flipped vertically as you move from one tile to the next in a column
		3 - Tiles are flipped horizontally as you move along a row and flipped vertically as you move along a column
		4 - No tiling takes place

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	a pointer to a new LinearGradientBrush object.
Failure:	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended may contain GPSTATUS error code ($GPID_ERR*).
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If $fIsAngleScalable is True, $iAngle specifies the base angle from which the angle of the directional line is calculated. Otherwise, $iAngle specifies the angle of the directional line. The angle is measured from the top of the rectangle and must be in degrees. The gradient follows the directional line.
After you are done with the object, call <a href="_GDIPlus_BrushDispose.htm">_GDIPlus_BrushDispose()</a> to release the object resources.

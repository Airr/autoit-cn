@@ParamTable@@
$tagNMHDR
	Contains information about a notification message
Start
	Index of the item at which the search will start
Flags
	Type of search to perform. This member can be set to one or more of the following values:
	$LVFI_PARAM - Searches for a match between this structure's Param member and the Param member of an item.
	If $LVFI_PARAM is specified, all other flags are ignored.
	$LVFI_PARTIAL - Checks to see if the item text begins with the string pointed to by the Text member. This
	value implies use of $LVFI_STRING.
	$LVFI_STRING - Searches based on the item text. Unless additional values are specified, the item text of
	the matching item must exactly match the string pointed to by the Text member.
	$LVFI_WRAP - Continues the search at the beginning if no match is found
	LVFI_NEARESTXY - Finds the item nearest to the position specified in the X and Y members, in the direction
	specified by the Direction member. This flag is supported only by large icon and small icon modes.
$tagLVFINDINFO
	Text - Address of a string to compare with the item text. It is valid if $LVFI_STRING or $LVFI_PARTIAL is set in the Flags member.
	Param - Value to compare with the Param member of an item's $LVITEM structure. It is valid only if $LVFI_PARAM is set in the flags member.
	X - Initial X search position. It is valid only if $LVFI_NEARESTXY is set in the Flags member.
	Y - Initial Y search position. It is valid only if $LVFI_NEARESTXY is set in the Flags member.
	Direction - Virtual key code that specifies the direction to search. The following codes are supported:
	VK_LEFT
	VK_RIGHT
	VK_UP
	VK_DOWN
	VK_HOME
	VK_END
	VK_PRIOR
	VK_NEXT
	This member is valid only if $LVFI_NEARESTXY is set in the flags member.

###Remarks###
This notification gives an application (or the notification receiver) the opportunity to customize an incremental search.
For example, if the search items are numeric, the application can perform a numerical search instead of a string search.
The application sets the Param member to the result of the search, or to another application defined value to fail the
search and indicate to the control how to proceed

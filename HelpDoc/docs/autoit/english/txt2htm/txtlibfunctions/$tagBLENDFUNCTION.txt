###Structure Name###
$tagBLENDFUNCTION

###Description###
$tagBLENDFUNCTION structure controls blending by specifying the blending functions for source and destination bitmaps

###Syntax###
Global Const $tagBLENDFUNCTION = "byte Op;byte Flags;byte Alpha;byte Format"


###Fields###
@@ParamTable@@
Op
	Specifies the source blend operation:
Flags
	Must be zero
Alpha
	Specifies an alpha transparency value to be used on the entire source bitmap. This value is combined
	with any per-pixel alpha values in the source bitmap. If set to 0, it is assumed that your image is
	transparent. Set to 255 (opaque) when you only want to use per-pixel alpha values.
Format
	This member controls the way the source and destination bitmaps are interpreted:
	$AC_SRC_ALPHA - This flag is set when the bitmap has an Alpha channel (that is, per-pixel alpha). Note that
	the APIs use premultiplied alpha, which means that the red, green and blue channel values in the bitmap must
	be premultiplied with the alpha channel value.

###Remarks###
The source bitmap used with $tagBLENDFUNCTION must be 32 bpp

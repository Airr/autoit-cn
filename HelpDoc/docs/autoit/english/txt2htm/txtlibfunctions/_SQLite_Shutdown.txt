###Remarks###
If <a href="_SQLite_Startup.htm">_SQLite_Startup()</a> failed or was not executed, an AutoIt runtime error will be thrown, and the script will terminate!
AutoIt automatically closes any dlls it opened, but calling <a href="_SQLite_Shutdown.htm">_SQLite_Shutdown()</a> is still a good idea.

###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathCreate2

###Description###
Creates a GraphicsPath object based on an array of points, an array of types, and a fill mode

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathCreate2 ( $aPathData [, $iFillMode = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$aPathData
	Array of points and types that specifies the endpoints and control points of the lines and bezier splines that are used to draw the path and the points types:
		[0][0] - Number of points and types
		[1][0] - Point 1 X position
		[1][1] - Point 1 Y position
		[1][2] - Point 1 type
		[n][0] - Point n X position
		[n][1] - Point n Y position
		[1][2] - Point n type
	Each point type is one of the following values:
		0x00 - The point is the start of a figure
		0x01 - The point is one of the two endpoints of a line
		0x03 - The point is an endpoint or control point of a cubic bezier spline
		0x20 - The point is a marker
		0x80 - The point is the last point in a closed subpath (figure)
$iFillMode
	[optional] Fill mode of the interior of the path figures:
		0 - The areas are filled according to the even-odd parity rule
		1 - The areas are filled according to the nonzero winding rule

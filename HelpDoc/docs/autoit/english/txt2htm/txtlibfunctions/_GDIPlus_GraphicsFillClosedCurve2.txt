###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_GraphicsFillClosedCurve2

###Description###
Creates a closed cardinal spline from an array of points and uses a brush to fill the interior of the spline

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_GraphicsFillClosedCurve2 ( $hGraphics, $aPoints, $nTension [, $hBrush = 0 [, $iFillMode = 0]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hGraphics
	Pointer to a Graphics object
$aPoints
	Array of points that specify the coordinates of the closed cardinal spline:
	[0][0] - Number of points
	[1][0] - Point 1 X position
	[1][1] - Point 1 Y position
	[2][0] - Point 2 X position
	[2][1] - Point 2 Y position
	[n][0] - Point n X position
	[n][1] - Point n Y position
$nTension
	Number that specifies how tightly the spline bends as it passes through the points
$hBrush
	[optional] Handle to a brush object that is used to fill the cardinal spline. If 0, a black brush will be used.
$iFillMode
	[optional] Fill mode of the interior of the spline:
	0 - The areas are filled according to the even-odd parity rule
	1 - The areas are filled according to the nonzero winding rule

###ReturnValue###
Success: True
Failure: False and either:

	@error and @extended are set if DllCall failed

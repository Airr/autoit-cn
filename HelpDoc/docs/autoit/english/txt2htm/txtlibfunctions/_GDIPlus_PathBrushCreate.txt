###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$aPoints
	Array of points that specify the boundary path of the path gradient brush
		[0][0] - Number of points
		[1][0] - Point 1 X coordinate
		[1][1] - Point 1 Y coordinate
		[2][0] - Point 2 X coordinate
		[2][1] - Point 2 Y coordinate
		[n][0] - Point n X coordinate
		[n][1] - Point n Y coordinate
$iWrapMode
	[optional] Wrap mode that specifies how areas filled with the brush are tiled:
		0 - Tiling without flipping
		1 - Tiles are flipped horizontally as you move from one tile to the next in a row
		2 - Tiles are flipped vertically as you move from one tile to the next in a column
		3 - Tiles are flipped horizontally as you move along a row and flipped vertically as you move along a column
		4 - No tiling takes place

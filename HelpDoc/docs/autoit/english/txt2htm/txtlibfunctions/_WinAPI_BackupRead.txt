###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_BackupRead

###Description###
Backs up a file or directory, including the security information.

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPIFiles.au3>
_WinAPI_BackupRead ( $hFile, $pBuffer, $iLength, ByRef $iBytes, ByRef $pContext [, $fSecurity = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hFile
	Handle to the file or directory to be backed up. To obtain the handle, call the _WinAPI_CreateFileEx()
	function. The SACLs are not read unless the file handle was created with the $ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY
	access right.
$pBuffer
	A pointer to a buffer that receives the data.
$iLength
	The size of the buffer, in bytes. The buffer size must be greater than the size of the
	$tagWIN32_STREAM_ID structure.

	(see MSDN for more information)
$iBytes
	The number of bytes read.
$pContext
	A pointer to an internal data structure used by this function to maintain context information during
	a backup operation. You must set this variable to 0 before the first call to _WinAPI_BackupRead()
	for the specified file or directory. The function allocates memory for the data structure, and then
	sets the variable to point to that structure. You must not change this variable or the variable
	that it points to between calls to _WinAPI_BackupRead().
$fSecurity
	[optional] Specifies whether the function will backup the access-control list (ACL) data, valid values:
	True      - The ACL data will be backed up.
	False     - The ACL data will be omitted (Default).

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success 	True.
Failure 	False, call _WinAPI_GetLastError() to get extended error information.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The _WinAPI_BackupRead() is not intended for use in backing up files encrypted under the Encrypted File System (EFS).

If an error occurs during the data reading, the calling process can skip the bad data by calling the
_WinAPI_BackupSeek() function.

When you are done using _WinAPI_BackupRead(), you must call _WinAPI_BackupReadAbort() function with the appropriate
parameter to release the memory used by the internal data structure.

The file or directory should be restored using the _WinAPI_BackupWrite() function.

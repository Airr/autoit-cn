###Fields###
@@ParamTable@@
length
	Specifies the length, in bytes, of the structure
flags
	Specifies flags that control the position of the minimized window and the method by which the window is restored. This member can be one or more of the following values
	$WPF_ASYNCWINDOWPLACEMENT - If the calling thread and the thread that owns the window are attached to different input queues, the system posts the request to the thread that owns the window.
	$WPF_RESTORETOMAXIMIZED - Specifies that the restored window will be maximized, regardless of whether it was maximized before it was minimized.
	This setting is only valid the next time the window is restored. It does not change the default restoration behavior.
	This flag is only valid when the @SW_SHOWMINIMIZED value is specified for the showCmd member.
	$WPF_SETMINPOSITION - Specifies that the coordinates of the minimized window may be specified.
	This flag must be specified if the coordinates are set in the ptMinPosition member.
showCmd
	Specifies the current show state of the window. This member can be one of the following values:
	@SW_HIDE - Hides the window and activates another window.
	@SW_MAXIMIZE - Maximizes the specified window.
	@SW_MINIMIZE - Minimizes the specified window and activates the next top-level window in the z-order.
	@SW_RESTORE - Activates and displays the window. If the window is minimized or maximized, the system restores it to its original size and position.
	An application should specify this flag when restoring a minimized window.
	@SW_SHOW - Activates the window and displays it in its current size and position.
	@SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED - Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.
	@SW_SHOWMINIMIZED - Activates the window and displays it as a minimized window.
	@SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE - Displays the window as a minimized window.
	This value is similar to @SW_SHOWMINIMIZED, except the window is not activated.
	@SW_SHOWNA - Displays the window in its current size and position.
	This value is similar to @SW_SHOW, except the window is not activated.
	@SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE - Displays a window in its most recent size and position.
	This value is similar to @SW_SHOWNORMAL, except the window is not activated.
	@SW_SHOWNORMAL - Activates and displays a window.
	If the window is minimized or maximized, the system restores it to its original size and position.
	An application should specify this flag when displaying the window for the first time.
ptMinPosition
	Specifies the coordinates of the window's upper-left corner when the window is minimized.
ptMaxPosition
	Specifies the coordinates of the window's upper-left corner when the window is maximized.
rcNormalPosition
	Specifies the window's coordinates when the window is in the restored position.

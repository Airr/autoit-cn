@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
None.


###Remarks###
Some internal properties of a tool are established when the tool is created, and are not recomputed when a
$TTM_SETTOOLINFO message is sent. If you simply assign values to a TOOLINFO structure and pass it to the
ToolTip control with a $TTM_SETTOOLINFO message, these properties may be lost. Instead your application should
first request the tool's current TOOLINFO structure by sending a $TTM_GETTOOLINFO message. Then, modify the
members of this structure as needed and pass it back to the ToolTip control with $TTM_SETTOOLINFO. When
calling $TTM_SETTOOLINFO, the string pointed to by the Text member of the TOOLINFO structure must not exceed
80 characters in length.

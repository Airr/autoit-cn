		$TTF_CENTERTIP	- Centers the tooltip below the control specified by $iID
		$TTF_RTLREADING	- Indicates that text will be displayed in the opposite direction (right to left)

###ReturnValue###
None.


###Remarks###
Some internal properties of a tool are established when the tool is created, and are not recomputed when a $TTM_SETTOOLINFO message is sent.
If you simply assign values to a TOOLINFO structure and pass it to the ToolTip control with a $TTM_SETTOOLINFO message, these properties may be lost.
Instead your application should first request the tool's current TOOLINFO structure by sending a $TTM_GETTOOLINFO message.
Then, modify the members of this structure as needed and pass it back to the ToolTip control with $TTM_SETTOOLINFO.
When calling $TTM_SETTOOLINFO, the string pointed to by the Text member of the TOOLINFO structure must not exceed 80 characters in length.

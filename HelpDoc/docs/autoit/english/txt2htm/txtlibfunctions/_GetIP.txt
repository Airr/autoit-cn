###Remarks###
This only returns the public IP address of a computer or network (i.e. the public IP on the WAN link of your NAT router). The address is determined by accessing an external IP discovery web site. The sites used are http://checkip.dyndns.org/, http://exip.org and http://www.myexternalip.com/.

Please refrain from using _GetIP in short time periods as not to overload the IP discovery sites.

###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_GetKeyState

###Description###
Retrieves the status of the specified virtual key.

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPISys.au3>
_WinAPI_GetKeyState ( $vKey )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$vKey
	Specifies a virtual key ($VK_*). If the desired virtual key is a letter or digit (A through Z,
	a through z, or 0 through 9).
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
Returns the value that specifies the status of the specified virtual key. If the high-order bit is 1, the key is
	down; otherwise, it is up. If the low-order bit is 1, the key is toggled. A key, such as the
	CAPS LOCK key, is toggled if it is turned on. The key is off and untoggled if the low-order bit is 0.
	A toggle key's indicator light (if any) on the keyboard will be on when the key is toggled, and off
	when the key is untoggled.


###Remarks###
The key status returned from this function changes as a process reads key messages from its message queue.
The status does not reflect the interrupt-level state associated with the hardware. Use the _WinAPI_GetAsyncKeyState()
function to retrieve that information.

###Description###
Continues an enumeration of network resources

_WinNet_EnumResource ( $hEnum, ByRef $iCount, $pBuffer, ByRef $iBufSize )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hEnum
	Handle that identifies an enumeration instance. The handle is returned by the _WinNet_OpenEnum() function.
$iCount
	Number of entries requested. If the number requested is –1, the function returns as many entries as possible.
	If the function succeeds, on return the variable contains the number of entries actually read.
$pBuffer
	Pointer to the buffer that receives the enumeration results.
	The results are returned as an array of $tagNETRESOURCE structures.
	The buffer must be large enough to hold the structures plus the strings to which their members point.
	The buffer is valid until the next call using the handle specified by hEnum.
	The order of $tagNETRESOURCE structures in the array is not predictable.
$iBufSize
	The size of the buffer, in bytes.
	If the buffer is too small to receive even one entry, this parameter receives the required size of the buffer.

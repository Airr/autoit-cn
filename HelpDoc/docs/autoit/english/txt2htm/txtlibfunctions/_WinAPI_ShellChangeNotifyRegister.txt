$aPaths

Success:	The registration ID.

###Remarks###
When a change notification event is raised, the message indicated by $iMsg is delivered to the window
specified by the $hWnd parameter.

For performance reasons, multiple notifications can be combined into a single notification. For example,
if a large number of $SHCNE_UPDATEITEM notifications are generated for files in the same folder, they can be
joined into a single $SHCNE_UPDATEDIR notification.

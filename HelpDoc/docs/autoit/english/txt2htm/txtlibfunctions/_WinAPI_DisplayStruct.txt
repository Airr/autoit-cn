###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$tStruct
	A structure that was created by DllStructCreate(), or memory address to be display its data.
$sStruct
	[optional] A string representing the structure.
	If $tStruct is a structure, this parameter can be omitted or be an empty string. In this case, the structure will display as "byte[n]" structure.
	If $tStruct is a memory address, $sStruct should be a string representing the structure, otherwise, the function fail, and @error set to 10.
$sTitle
	[optional] The title of the window, deault is "Structure: ListView Display".
$iItem
	[optional] The 1-based index or name of the structure member to be selected in the list.
	If this parameter is 0 (Default), or an incorrect index or name, the first element of the structure will be selected.
$iSubItem
	[optional] The 1-based index of the array in the structure member pointed to by the $iItem parameter to be selected.
	If $iItem was not defined as an array in the $sStruct, or invalid array index, the element pointed to by the $iItem parameter will be selected.
$iFlags
	[optional] A set of bit flags that specifies an additional displaying options.
	This parameter can be 0, or any combination of the following values:
		1 - Prevent displaying "<struct>" and "<endstruct>" fields at the beginning and end of the list.

		128 - Forced to display the values of the structure elements in the hexadecimal representation, if possibly.
		256 - Forced to return error code instead of displaying a message box if a memory access error occurred.
		512 - Forced to disable checking the read access memory allocated to a given structure.

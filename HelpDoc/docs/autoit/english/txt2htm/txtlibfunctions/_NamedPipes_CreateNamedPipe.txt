###User Defined Function###
_NamedPipes_CreateNamedPipe

###Description###
Creates an instance of a named pipe

###Syntax###
#include <NamedPipes.au3>
_NamedPipes_CreateNamedPipe ( $sName [, $iAccess = 2 [, $iFlags = 2 [, $iACL = 0 [, $iType = 1 [, $iRead = 1 [, $iWait = 0 [, $iMaxInst = 25 [, $iOutBufSize = 4096 [, $iInpBufSize = 4096 [, $iDefTimeout = 5000 [, $pSecurity = 0]]]]]]]]]]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sName
	Pipe name with the following format: \\.\pipe\pipename. The pipename part of the name can
	include any character other than a backslash, including numbers and special characters. The pipe name string
	can be up to 256 characters long. Pipe names are not case sensitive.
$iAccess
	[optional] The pipe access mode. Must be one of the following:
	0 - The flow of data in the pipe goes from client to server only (inbound)
	1 - The flow of data in the pipe goes from server to client only (outbound)
	2 - The pipe is bi-directional (duplex)
$iFlags
	[optional] The pipe flags. Can be any combination of the following:
	1 - If you attempt to create multiple instances of a pipe with this flag, creation of the first instance
	succeeds, but creation of the next instance fails.
	2 - Overlapped mode is enabled. If this mode is enabled functions performing read, write, and connect
	operations that may take a significant time to be completed can return immediately.
	4 - Write-through mode is enabled. This mode affects only write operations on byte type pipes and only when
	the client and server are on different computers.
$iACL
	[optional] Security ACL flags. Can be any combination of the following:
	1 - The caller will have write access to the named pipe's discretionary ACL
	2 - The caller will have write access to the named pipe's owner
	4 - The caller will have write access to the named pipe's security ACL
$iType
	[optional] Pipe type mode. Must be one of the following:
	0 - Data is written to the pipe as a stream of bytes
	1 - Data is written to the pipe as a stream of messages
$iRead
	[optional] Pipe read mode. Must be one of the following:
	0 - Data is read from the pipe as a stream of bytes
	1 - Data is read from the pipe as a stream of messages
$iWait
	[optional] Pipe wait mode. Must be one of the following:
	0 - Blocking mode is enabled. When the pipe handle is specified in ReadFile, WriteFile, or ConnectNamedPipe,
	the operation is not completed until there is data to read, all data is written, or a client is connected.
	1 - Nonblocking mode is enabled. ReadFile, WriteFile, and ConnectNamedPipe always return immediately.
$iMaxInst
	[optional] The maximum number of instances that can be created for this pipe
$iOutBufSize
	[optional] The number of bytes to reserve for the output buffer
$iInpBufSize
	[optional] The number of bytes to reserve for the input buffer
$iDefTimeOut
	[optional] The default time out value, in milliseconds
$pSecurity
	[optional] A pointer to a tagSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that specifies a security descriptor for the
	new named pipe and determines whether child processes can inherit the returned handle. If pSecurity is 0, the
	named pipe gets a default security descriptor and the handle cannot be inherited. The ACLs in the default
	security descriptor for a named pipe grant full control to the LocalSystem account administrators, and the
	creator owner. They also grant read access to members of the Everyone group and the anonymous account.

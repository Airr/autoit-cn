###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_SearchPath

###Description###
Searches for a specified file in a specified path.

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPIFiles.au3>
_WinAPI_SearchPath ( $sFile [, $sPath = ''] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sFile
	The name of the file for which to search.
$sPath
	[optional] The path to be searched for the file. If this parameter is omitted or an empty string (Default), the function
	searches for a matching file using a registry-dependent system search path (see below).
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success 	The path of the file found.
Failure 	Sets the @error flag to non-zero, call _WinAPI_GetLastError() to get extended error information.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If the path is an empty string, _WinAPI_SearchPath() searches for a matching file based on the current value
of the following registry value:

	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeProcessSearchMode

When the value of this registry value is set to 1, _WinAPI_SearchPath() first searches the folders that are
specified in the system path, and then searches the current working folder. When the value of this registry value
is set to 0, the computer first searches the current working folder, and then searches the folders that are
specified in the system path. The system default value for this registry key is 0.

This function is not recommended as a method of locating a .dll file if the intended use of the output is in
a call to the _WinAPI_LoadLibrary() function. This can result in locating the wrong .dll file because the search
order of the _WinAPI_SearchPath() function differs from the search order used by the _WinAPI_LoadLibrary()
function. If you need to locate and load a .dll file, use the _WinAPI_LoadLibrary() function.

The search mode used by the _WinAPI_SearchPath() function can also be set per-process by calling the
_WinAPI_SetSearchPathMode() function.

###Remarks###
The number of desktops that can be created is limited by the size of the system desktop heap. You can increase the
number of desktops that can be created by increasing the size of the desktop heap or by reducing the default heap
reserved for each desktop in the interactive window station. The default size of the desktop heap depends on factors
such as hardware architecture. To retrieve the size of the heap, call the _WinAPI_GetUserObjectInformation()
function with $UOI_HEAPSIZE.

When you are finished using the desktop, call the _WinAPI_CloseDesktop() function to close it.

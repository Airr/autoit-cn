@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	The array that contains the following information:
	[0] - If True, there is a system power button.
	[1] - If True, there is a system sleep button.
	[2] - If True, there is a lid switch.
	[3] - If True, the operating system supports sleep state S1.
	[4] - If True, the operating system supports sleep state S2.
	[5] - If True, the operating system supports sleep state S3.
	[6] - If True, the operating system supports sleep state S4 (hibernation).
	[7] - If True, the operating system supports power off state S5 (soft off).
	[8] - If True, the system hibernation file is present.
	[9] - If True, the system supports wake capabilities.
	[10] - If True, the system supports video display dimming capabilities.
	[11] - If True, the system supports APM BIOS power management features.
	[12] - If True, there is an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
	[13] - If True, the system supports thermal zones.
	[14] - If True, the system supports processor throttling.
	[15] - The minimum level of system processor throttling supported, expressed as a percentage.
	[16] - The maximum level of system processor throttling supported, expressed as a percentage.
	[17] - If True, the system supports the hybrid sleep state.
	[18] - If True, the system supports allowing the removal of power to fixed disk devices.
	[19] - If True, there are one or more batteries in the system.
	[20] - If True, the system batteries are short-term. Short-term batteries are used in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).
	[21] - The lowest system sleep state (Sx) that will generate a wake event when the system is on AC power.
	[22] - The lowest system sleep state (Sx) that will generate a wake event via the lid switch.
	[23] - The lowest system sleep state (Sx) supported by hardware that will generate a wake event via the RTC.
	[24] - The minimum allowable system power state supporting wake events.
Failure:	Sets the @error flag to non-zero, call <a href="_WinAPI_GetLastError.htm">_WinAPI_GetLastError()</a> to get extended error information.

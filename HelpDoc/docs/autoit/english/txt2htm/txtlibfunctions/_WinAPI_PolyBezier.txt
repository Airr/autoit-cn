###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_PolyBezier

###Description###
Draws one or more Bezier curves.

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPIGdi.au3>
_WinAPI_PolyBezier ( $hDC, Const ByRef $aPoint [, $iStart = 0 [, $iEnd = -1]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDC
	Handle to a device context.
$aPoint
	The 2D array ([x1, y1], [x2, y2], ... [xN, yN]) that contains the endpoints and control points of the
	curve(s), in logical units. The number of points must be one more than three times the number of curves
	to be drawn, because each Bezier curve requires two control points and an endpoint, and the initial
	curve requires an additional starting point.
$iStart
	[optional] The index of array to start drawing at.
$iEnd
	[optional] The index of array to stop drawing at.

###ReturnValue###

Success 	True
Failure 	False

###Remarks###
This function draws cubic Bezier curves by using the endpoints and control points specified by the $aPoint
parameter. The first curve is drawn from the first point to the fourth point by using the second and third points
as control points. Each subsequent curve in the sequence needs exactly three more points: the ending point of the
previous curve is used as the starting point, the next two points in the sequence are control points, and the
third is the ending point.

The current position is neither used nor updated by the _WinAPI_PolyBezier() function. The figure is not filled.

This function draws lines by using the current pen.

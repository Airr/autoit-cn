###Remarks###
If Word was not running when <a href="_Word_Create.htm">_Word_Create()</a> was called then <a href="_Word_Quit.htm">_Word_Quit()</a> closes all documents of the specified
instance (even those opened manually by the user after <a href="_Word_Create.htm">_Word_Create()</a> ) and the Word application.
If Word was running you have to set $bForceClose to True to do the same.

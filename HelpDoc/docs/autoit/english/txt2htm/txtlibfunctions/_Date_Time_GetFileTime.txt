###User Defined Function###
_Date_Time_GetFileTime

###Description###
Retrieves the date and time that a file was created, accessed and modified

###Syntax###
#include <Date.au3>
_Date_Time_GetFileTime ( $hFile )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hFile
	Handle to the file for which dates and times are to be retrieved. The file handle must have been created using the CreateFile function with the GENERIC_READ access right.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
Returns an array with the following format:
	[0] - $tagFILETIME structure with the date and time the file was created
	[1] - $tagFILETIME structure with the date and time the file was accessed
	[2] - $tagFILETIME structure with the date and time the file was modified


###Remarks###
Not all file systems can record creation and last access times and not all file systems record them in the same manner.
For example, on FAT, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write time has a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day (really, the access date). Therefore, the <a href="_Date_Time_GetFileTime.htm">_Date_Time_GetFileTime()</a> function may not return the same file time information set using <a href="_Date_Time_SetFileTime.htm">_Date_Time_SetFileTime()</a>.
NTFS delays updates to the last access time for a file by up to one hour after the last access.

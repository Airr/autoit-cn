###Remarks###
Calling this function causes the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to invalidate its current bitmaps for the window and request new bitmaps from the window when they are next needed. <a href="_WinAPI_DwmInvalidateIconicBitmaps.htm">_WinAPI_DwmInvalidateIconicBitmaps()</a> should  not be called frequently.
Doing so can lead to poor performance as new bitmaps are created and retrieved.

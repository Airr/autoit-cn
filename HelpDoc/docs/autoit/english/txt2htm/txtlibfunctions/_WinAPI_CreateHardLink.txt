###Remarks###
The <a href="_WinAPI_CreateHardLink.htm">_WinAPI_CreateHardLink()</a> is only supported on the NTFS file system, and only for files, not directories.

The security descriptor belongs to the file to which a hard link points. The link itself is only a directory entry, and does not have a security descriptor.
Therefore, when you change the security descriptor of a hard link, you a change the security descriptor of the underlying file, and all hard links that point to the file allow the newly specified access.
You cannot give a file different security descriptors on a per-hard-link basis.

Use <a href="_WinAPI_DeleteFile.htm">_WinAPI_DeleteFile()</a> function to delete hard links. You can delete them in any order regardless of the order in which they are created.

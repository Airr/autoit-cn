@@ParamTable@@
$aSnd_id
	Sound ID array as returned by <a href="_SoundOpen.htm">_SoundOpen()</a> or a file name
$iMode
	[optional] This flag determines which format the position of the sound is returned in
		1 = (by default) hh:mm:ss where h = hours, m = minutes and s = seconds (default)

@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	the sound position.
Failure:	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@error:	1 = $iMode is invalid
	3 = Invalid Sound ID. Use return array from <a href="_SoundOpen.htm">_SoundOpen()</a> or a valid file name.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
It is recommended to open a sound file with <a href="_SoundOpen.htm">_SoundOpen()</a> and pass the ID array rather than use the file name in this function.  A VBR encoded file is very unlikely to return the correct position if the file name is passed directly to this function.

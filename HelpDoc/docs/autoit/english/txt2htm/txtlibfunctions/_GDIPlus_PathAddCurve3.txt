###User Defined Function###
_GDIPlus_PathAddCurve3

###Description###
Adds a cardinal spline to the current figure of a path

###Syntax###
#include <GDIPlus.au3>
_GDIPlus_PathAddCurve3 ( $hPath, $aPoints, $iOffset, $iNumOfSegments [, $fTension = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hPath
	Pointer to a GraphicsPath object
$aPoints
	Array of points that define the cardinal spline:
		[0][0] - Number of points
		[1][0] - Point 1 X position
		[1][1] - Point 1 Y position
		[2][0] - Point 2 X position
		[2][1] - Point 2 Y position
		[n][0] - Point n X position
		[n][1] - Point n Y position
$iOffset
	The index of the array element that is used as the first point of the cardinal spline,
	this is the index of the specific point in the array minus 1
$iNumOfSegments
	Number of segments in the cardinal spline. Segments are the curves that connect consecutive points in the array
$fTension
	[optional] Nonnegative real number that controls the length of the curve and how the curve bends.
	As the value increases, the curve becomes fuller.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	True.
Failure:	False and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended may contain GPSTATUS ($GPID_ERR*).
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The cardinal spline is a curve that passes through a subset (specified by the $iOffset and $iNumOfSegments parameters) of the points in the array

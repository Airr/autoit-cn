###User Defined Function###
_NamedPipes_TransactNamedPipe

###Description###
Reads and writes to a named pipe in one network operation

###Syntax###
#include <NamedPipes.au3>
_NamedPipes_TransactNamedPipe ( $hNamedPipe, $pInpBuf, $iInpSize, $pOutBuf, $iOutSize [, $pOverlapped = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hNamedPipe
	The handle to the named pipe
$pInpBuf
	Pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written to the pipe
$iInpSize
	Size of the write buffer, in bytes
$pOutBuf
	Pointer to the buffer that receives the data read from the pipe
$iOutSize
	Size of the read buffer, in bytes
$pOverlapped
	[optional] Pointer to a $tagOVERLAPPED structure.
		This structure is required if hNamedPipe was opened with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED.
		If hNamedPipe was opened with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, pOverlapped must not be 0.
		If hNamedPipe was opened with $PIPE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and pOverlapped is not 0, TransactNamedPipe is executed as an overlapped operation.
		The $tagOVERLAPPED structure should contain a manual reset event object.
		If the operation cannot be completed immediately, TransactNamedPipe returns False and GetLastError will return ERROR_IO_PENDING.

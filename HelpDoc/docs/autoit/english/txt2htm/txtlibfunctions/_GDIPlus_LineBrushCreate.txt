@@ParamTable@@
$iX1
	X coordinate of the starting point of the gradient. The starting boundary line passes through the
$iY1
	Y coordinate of the starting point of the gradient. The starting boundary line passes through the
$iX2
	X coordinate of the ending point of the gradient. The ending boundary line passes through the

		2 - Tiles are flipped vertically as you move from one tile to the next in a column
		3 - Tiles are flipped horizontally as you move along a row and flipped vertically as you move along a column
		4 - No tiling takes place

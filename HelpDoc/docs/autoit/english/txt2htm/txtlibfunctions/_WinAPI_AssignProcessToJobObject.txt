###Remarks###
After you associate a process with a job object, the process is subject to the limits set for the job.
To set limits for a job, use the <a href="_WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject.htm">_WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject()</a> function.

The process can be associated only with a single job.
The process inherits limits from the job it is associated with and adds its accounting information to the job.
If a process is associated with a job, all processes it  creates are associated with that job by default.

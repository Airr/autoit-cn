###Remarks###
If the source name cannot be found, the event logging service uses the Application log; it does not create a new source.
Events are reported for the source, however, there are no message and category message files
specified for looking up descriptions of the event identifiers for the source.
To close the handle to the event log, use the _EventLog__DeregisterSource().

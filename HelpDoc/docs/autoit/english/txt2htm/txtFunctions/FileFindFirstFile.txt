###Description###
Returns a search "handle" according to file search string.

###Syntax###
FileFindFirstFile ( "filename" )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
filename
	The path and file name. (* and ? wildcards accepted - See Remarks)
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	a search "handle" for use with subsequent FileFindNextFile functions.
Failure:	-1 if nothing is found. The value of the @error flag is set to 1 only if the Folder is empty.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The search string is not case sensitive.
Wildcards:  In general, <strong>*</strong> denotes zero or more characters, and <strong>?</strong> denotes zero or one character.  If your file search string contains only wildcards (or is "*.*"), then see the example below for the return value!

You can use only one wildcard in the filename part or in the extension part i.e. a*.b?.
When using a 3-char extension any extension starting with those 3 chars will match, .e.g. "*.log" will match "test.log_1". (not described either in Microsoft documentation).

When you have finished searching with the FileFind... functions you must call <a href="FileClose.htm">FileClose()</a> to release the search handle.

Directory name are returned according to the wildcards if any.

Due to the underlying Windows API used (FindFirstFile), this function actually searches both the long and short filenames when looking for matches. If you get unexepected results
then verfiy that it's not the short filename that is being matched.

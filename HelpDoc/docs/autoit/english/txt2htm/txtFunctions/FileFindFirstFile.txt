###Syntax###

@@ParamTable@@

	The path and file name. (* and ? wildcards accepted - See Remarks)
@@End@@

@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	a search "handle" for use with subsequent FileFindNextFile functions.
Failure:	-1 if nothing is found. The value of the @error flag is set to 1 only if the Folder is empty.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The search string is not case sensitive.
Wildcards:  In general, <b>*</b> denotes zero or more characters, and <b>?</b> denotes zero or one character.  If your file search string contains only wildcards (or is "*.*"), then see the example below for the return value!

You can use only one wildcard in the filename part or in the extension part i.e. a*.b?.
?? seems equivalent to * (not described in Microsoft documentation).
When using a 3-char extension any extension starting with those 3 chars will match, .e.g. "*.log" will match "test.log_1". (not described either in Microsoft documentation).

When you have finished searching with the FileFind... functions you must call <a href="FileClose.htm">FileClose()</a> to release the search handle.

Directory name are return according to the wildcards if any.

Success:	a binary string and @extended set to the number of bytes downloaded.
Failure:	"" (empty string) and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
Internet Explorer 3 or greater must be installed for this function to work.

The URL parameter should be in the form "http://www.somesite.com/path/file.html" - just like an address you would type into your web browser.

To use a username and password when connecting simply prefix the servername with "username:password@", e.g.
"http://myuser:mypassword@www.somesite.com"

The returned data is in binary format.  The <a href="BinaryToString.htm">BinaryToString()</a> function can be used to convert the data to a string.

By default AutoIt forces a connection before starting a download.  For dial-up users this will prompt to go online or dial the modem (depending on how the system is configured).  The options value $INET_FORCEBYPASS (16) disables this behavior.  Disabling the behavior can be useful for persistent connects (Broadband, LAN).  However, it is also required to work around certain issues in Windows Vista and Windows 7.

###Remarks###
If a filename is given rather than a file handle - the file will be opened and closed during the function call.
Note: Do not mix filehandles and filenames, i.e., don't <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen()</a> a file and then use a filename in this function.  Use either filehandles or filenames in your routines, not both!

If a file handle is used then the "mode" parameter has no effect - the mode used for <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen()</a> takes precedence.

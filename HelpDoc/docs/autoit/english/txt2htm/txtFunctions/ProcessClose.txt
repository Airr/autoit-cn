###Remarks###
Process names are executables without the full path, e.g., "notepad.exe" or "winword.exe"

If multiple processes have the same name, the one with the highest PID is terminated--regardless of how recently the process was spawned.

PID is the unique number which identifies a Process.  A PID can be obtained through the <a href="ProcessExists.htm">ProcessExists()</a> or <a href="Run.htm">Run()</a> commands.

The process is polled approximately every 250 milliseconds.

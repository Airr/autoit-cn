Fractional portions are truncated, so <a href="Int.htm">Int</a>(1.999999) returns 1
<a href="Int.htm">Int</a>(0/0) returns -9223372036854775807, if you were wondering.
This function makes minor corrects to floating point numbers to account for the imprecise nature of floating point numbers.  For example, the floating point expression 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 produces a floating point number that is not quite 1.0.  <a href="Int.htm">Int()</a> corrects for this anomaly, however, certain extremely rare circumstances may lead to <a href="Int.htm">Int()</a> returning an unexpected value (the odds of getting an unexpected value are less than if <a href="Int.htm">Int()</a> did not attempt any correction at all).

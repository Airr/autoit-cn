###Function###
StringSplit

###Description###
Splits up a string into substrings depending on the given delimiters.

###Syntax###
StringSplit ( "string", "delimiters" [, flag = 0] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
string
	The string to evaluate.
delimiters
	One or more characters to use as delimiters (case sensitive).
flag
	[optional] Changes how the string split works, add multiple flag values together if required:
	$STR_CHRSPLIT (0) = each character in the delimiter string will mark where to split the string (default)
	$STR_ENTIRESPLIT (1) = entire delimiter string is needed to mark the split
	$STR_NOCOUNT (2) = disable the return count in the first element - effectively makes the array 0-based (must use <a href="UBound.htm">UBound()</a> to get the size of the array in 	this case).
	Constants are defined in Constants.au3

###ReturnValue###
Returns an array, by default the first element ($aArray[0]) contains the number of strings returned, the remaining elements ($aArray[1], $aArray[2], etc.) contain the delimited strings. If the flag parameter is set to $STR_NOCOUNT (2) then the count is not returned in the first element.

If no delimiters were found then @error is set to 1, count is equal to 1 ($aArray[0]) and the full string is returned ($aArray[1]).


###Remarks###
If you use an empty string "" for the delimiters, each character will be returned as an element.

If the delimiter you wish to use is a substring instead of individual single characters, see the example below.

<a href="StringSplit.htm">StringSplit()</a> is very useful as an alternative to <a href="StringInStr.htm">StringInStr()</a> as well as a means to populate an array.

Note that if you use the macro @CRLF you are referring to a 2 character string, so this will generate extra blanks lines. Therefore it is recommended to set the flag parameter to $STR_ENTIRESPLIT (1).

To use the values specified above you must #include <StringConstants.au3> in your script.

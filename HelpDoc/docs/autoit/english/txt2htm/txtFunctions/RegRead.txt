###Remarks###
A registry key must start with "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" ("HKLM") or "HKEY_USERS" ("HKU") or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" ("HKCU") or "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT" ("HKCR") or "HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG" ("HKCC").

When running on 64-bit Windows if you want to read a value specific to the 64-bit environment you have to suffix the HK... with 64 i.e. HKLM64.

AutoIt supports registry keys of type REG_BINARY, REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_QWORD, and REG_DWORD.

To access the <b>(Default)</b> value use <b>""</b> (an empty string) for the valuename.

When reading a REG_BINARY key the result is a binary datatype (in previous versions it was a string of hex characters).

When reading a REG_MULTI_SZ key the multiple entries are separated by @LF - use with <a href="StringSplit.htm">StringSplit</a>(..., @LF) to get each entry.

It is possible to access remote registries by using a keyname in the form "\\computername\keyname".  To use this feature you must have the correct access rights.

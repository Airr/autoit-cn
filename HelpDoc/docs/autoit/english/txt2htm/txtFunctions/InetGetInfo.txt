		$INET_DOWNLOADREAD (0) - Bytes read so far (this is updated while the download progresses).
		$INET_DOWNLOADSIZE (1) - The size of the download in bytes (this may not always be present).
		$INET_DOWNLOADCOMPLETE (2) - Set to True if the download is complete, False if the download is still ongoing.
		$INET_DOWNLOADSUCCESS (3) - True if the download was successful.  If this is False then the next data member will be non-zero.

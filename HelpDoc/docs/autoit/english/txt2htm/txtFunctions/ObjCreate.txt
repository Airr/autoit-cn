If you want to connect to an existing process, use <a href="ObjGet.htm">ObjGet()</a> instead.

Keep in mind that not all computers have the same set of Objects. So <b>always</b> check for errors after calling <a href="ObjCreate.htm">ObjCreate()</a>.

The following requirements apply if you want to access objects on <i>remote</i> computers:
-The user running the script must have the appropriate permissions.
-The Object on the remote computer must support DCOM (Distributed COM)
-The remote computer must have 'Remote Registry Service' and 'File and Printer sharing' services running.

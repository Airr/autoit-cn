###Remarks###
<a href="ConsoleRead.htm">ConsoleRead()</a> reads from the console standard input stream of the AutoIt script process, which is normally used by console applications to read input from a parent process.
<a href="ConsoleRead.htm">ConsoleRead()</a> does not block, it will return immediately.  In order to get all data, it must be called in a loop.
Peeking on the stream does not remove the data from the buffer, however, it does return the available data as normal.
By default, data is returned in text format.  By using the binary option, the data will be returned in binary format.

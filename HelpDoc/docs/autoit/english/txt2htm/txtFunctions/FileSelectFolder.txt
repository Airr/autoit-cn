###Remarks###
The root dir will be chosen if the initial dir (if given) does not exist.
A nonexistent root dir will also cause the Desktop folder to be root.
The "Create Folder Button" option may require Windows XP with IE6 in order to work.
Special Windows folders (such as "My Documents") can be set as root by using the right CLSID detailed in the <a href="../appendix/clsid.htm">Appendix</a>.
UNC paths are not supported.  If you think that user's may choose files on a UNC path then the path needs to be mapped as a drive first.

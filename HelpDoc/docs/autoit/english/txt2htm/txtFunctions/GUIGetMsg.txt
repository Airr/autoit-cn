When using the "advanced" parameter the information is returned in an array with extended information:

$aArray[0] = 0 or Event ID or Control ID
$aArray[1] = The window handle the event is from
$aArray[2] = The control handle the event is from (if applicable)
$aArray[3] = The current X position of the mouse cursor (relative to the GUI window)
$aArray[4] = The current Y position of the mouse cursor (relative to the GUI window)
<br>
If the GUIOnEventMode option is set to 1 then the return from GUIGetMsg is always 0 and the @error is set to 1.

If the option GUIEventOptions is set to 1 the minimize, restore and maximize button will not do any action on the window just a simple notification.


###Remarks###
This function automatically idles the CPU when required so that it can be safely used in tight loops without hogging all the CPU.

Information about the mouse position and the hovering control can be retrieved with <a href="GUIGetCursorInfo.htm">GUIGetCursorInfo()</a>. No event is fired when the mouse is over a control so <a href="GUIGetCursorInfo.htm">GUIGetCursorInfo()</a> must be called to retrieve the ControlID.

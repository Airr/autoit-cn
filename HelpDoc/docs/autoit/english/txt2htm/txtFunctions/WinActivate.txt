###Remarks###
You can use the <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive()</a> function to check if <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate()</a> succeeded.  If multiple windows match the criteria, the window that was most recently active is the one activated.  <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate()</a> works on minimized windows.  However, a window that is "Always On Top" could still cover up a window you Activated.

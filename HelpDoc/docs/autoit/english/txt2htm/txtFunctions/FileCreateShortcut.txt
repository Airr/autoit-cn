###Remarks###
Hotkeys for windows shortcuts are of the following form:  Ctrl+Alt+X, Ctrl+Shift+X, Shift+Alt+X, Ctrl+NumPadKey, or Alt+NumPadKey where X represents a letter, number, punctuation, or function key.  If you specify an invalid form, Windows typically defaults to Ctrl+Alt
Note that Windows distinguishes number pad keys from regular number and punctuation keys.  <a href="FileCreateShortcut.htm">FileCreateShortcut()</a> allows you to create Ctrl+X and Alt+X shortcuts (which Windows normally only allows when X is a NumPadKey); however, you should avoid these assignments as they may conflict with standard application hotkeys.
Windows prohibits ESC, ENTER, TAB, SPACEBAR, PRINT SCREEN, SHIFT, or BACKSPACE from being used in hotkeys.

<a href="FileCreateShortcut.htm">FileCreateShortcut()</a> does not require a valid target, workdir, icon, or hotkey in order to "successfully" create the LNK file; however, the destination of the LNK file must be valid!  If the hotkey you choose is already in use, your new shortcut takes precedence.  Also, if you create a shortcut with the same path\name as as a pre-existing shortcut, it gets overwritten with your new version.

###Remarks###
<a href="WinMove.htm">WinMove()</a> has no effect on minimized windows, but <a href="WinMove.htm">WinMove()</a> works on hidden windows.
If the width and height are small (or negative), the window will go no smaller than 112 x 27 pixels.  If width and height are large, the window will go no larger than approximately [12+@DesktopWidth] x [12+@DesktopHeight] pixels.
Negative values are allowed for the x and y coordinates.  In fact, you can move a window off screen; and if the window's program is one that remembers its last window position, the window will appear in the corner (but fully on-screen) the next time you launch the program.
If multiple windows match the criteria, the most recently active window is used.

If x and y equal to the <a href="../keywords/Default.htm">Default keyword</a> no move occurs, just resizing.

When speed is used the move is done with the new size.

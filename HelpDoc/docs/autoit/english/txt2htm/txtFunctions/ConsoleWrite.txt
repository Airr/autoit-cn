###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
data

###ReturnValue###
The amount of data written.  If writing binary, the number of bytes written, if writing text, the number of characters written.


###Remarks###
The purpose for this function is to write to the STDOUT stream. Many popular text editors can read this stream. Scripts compiled as Console applications also have a STDOUT stream.

<b>This does not write to a DOS console unless the script is compiled as a console application.</b>

Characters are converted to ANSI before being written.

Binary data is written as-is. It will not be converted to a string. To print the hex representation of binary data, use the <a href="String.htm">String()</a> function to explicitly cast the data to a string.

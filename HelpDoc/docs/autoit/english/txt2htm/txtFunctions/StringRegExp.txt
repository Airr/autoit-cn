###Remarks###
The flag parameter can have one of 5 values (0 through 4).  Flag 0 returns 1 (true) or 0 (false) as to whether the pattern was found or not.  Flags 1 and 2 find the first match and return captured groups in an array; when the pattern has no capturing groups, the first match is returned in the array.  Flags 3 and 4 find multiple hits and fills the array with every matching text.  Flags 2 and 4 include the full matching text as the first element of the return array, not just the captured groups, which is all you get with flag 1 and 3.

Regular expression notation is a compact way of specifying a pattern for subject strings that can be searched and from where specific parts can be extracted by StringRegExp() or replaced when using StringRegExpReplace().
More precisely, the regular expression engine tries to match a pattern (a kind of programmatic format) with a subject string, both from left to right.  Should a mismatch occur, the engines tries to backtrack (return to successively previous states) as much as needed, expecting that the rest of the pattern will match as well.  Backtracking is a fundamental feature of PCRE expressions and one that every novice programmer already understand and uses daily.  It is like leaving a specific mark on every fork in the road and going back to the last one when the choosen path turns into a dead end: you backtrack as needed until you find the right point (match success) or explore every path without reaching your goal (match failure).  Searching a given filename with optional wildcards inside a directory tree is no different.

AutoIt uses the PCRE engine.  PCRE means "Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions" and is the most comprehensive open-source engine available.  This implementation includes Unicode Category Properties (UCP) support, which allows fine-grain processing of most human languages.
However to maintain compatibility with previous versions and keep matching speed at its best, <b>the UCP support is not enabled by default</b>.  You can enable it by prepending the string <b>(*UCP)</b> at the very start of your pattern.  When enabled, the UCP setting changes the extend of a number of regular expression elements, as documented below where applicable.

This page is only a summary for the most used pattern elements.  For full in-depth discussion of regular expressions as implemented in AutoIt, refer to the <b><a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/pcrepattern v8.33.html" target="_blank">complete description of PCRE patterns</a></b>.
Unless you are already familiar with regular expressions you will probably need to read several parts of this summary more than once to grasp how they work and inter-relate.

<b>Caution</b>: bad regular expressions can produce a quasi-infinite loop hogging the CPU, and can even cause a crash.


<b><u>Global settings</u></b>

These settings are only recognized at the start of the pattern and affect it globally.

<u>Newline conventions</u>
Newline sequences affect where the <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> anchors match. By default the newline sequence is @CRLF as an unbreakable sequence.
The default can be changed by prepending one of the following sequence at the start of a pattern.
@@ParamTable@@
<b>(*CR)</b>
	Carriage return (@CR).
<b>(*LF)</b>
	Line feed (@LF).
<b>(*CRLF)</b>
	Carriage return immediately followed by linefeed (@CRLF).  This is the default convention.
<b>(*ANYCRLF)</b>
	Any of @CRLF, @CR or @LF.
<b>(*ANY)</b>
	Any Unicode newline sequence: CRLF, LF, VT, FF, CR or x85.

<u>What <b>\R</b> matches</u>
@@ParamTable@@
<b>(*BSR_ANYCRLF)</b>
	Restrict <b>\R</b> to match CRLF, CR or LF only.
<b>(*BSR_UNICODE)</b>
	By default <b>\R</b> matches any Unicode newline sequence: CRLF, LF, VT, FF, CR or x85.
@@End@@


<b><u>Options</u></b>

PCRE patterns may contain options, which are enclosed in <b>(? )</b> sequences.  Options can be grouped together: "(?imx)".  Options following an hyphen are negated: "(?im-sx)".
Options appearing outside a group affect the remaining of the pattern.  Options appearing in a group affect this group only.  Options loose their special meaning inside a character class, where they mean themselves.

@@ParamTable@@
<b>(?i)</b>
	Caseless: matching becomes case-insensitive from that point on.  By default, matching is case-sensitive.  When UCP is enabled casing applies to the entire Unicode plane 0, else applies by default to ASCII letters A-Z and a-z only. 
<b>(?m)</b>
	Multiline: <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> match at newline sequences within data.  By default, multiline is off.
<b>(?s)</b>
	Single-line or <i>DotAll</i>: <b>.</b> matches anything including a newline sequence.  By default <b>.</b> doesn't match a newline sequence.
<b>(?U)</b>
	Ungreedy: quantifiers become lazy (non-greedy) from that point on.  By default, matching is greedy.
<b>(?x)</b>
	eXtended: whitespaces outside character classes are ignored and <b>#</b> starts a comment up to the next solid newline in pattern.  Meaningless whitespaces between components make regular expressions much more readable.  By default, whitespaces match themselves and <b>#</b> is a literal character.

<b><u>Characters, metacharacters and quoting</u></b>

Regular expressions patterns consist of literal text parts which match themselves, intermixed with regular expression specifiers or options.  Specifiers and options use a few <u>metacharacters</u> which have a special meaning described in the tables below.  If a character is not in the following tables, then it will match only itself.
PCRE metacharacters are <b>\ . ^ $ | [ ( { * + ? #</b> which have one or more special meaning, depending on context.
The special sequences below are used to represent certain characters literally.

@@ParamTable@@
<b>\a</b>
	Represents "alarm", the BEL character (Chr(7)).
<b>\c</b><i>X</i>
	Represents "control-<i>X</i>", where <i>X</i> is any 7-bit ASCII character.  For example, "\cM" represents ctrl-M, same as \x0D or \r (Chr(13)).
<b>\e</b>
	Represents "escape" (Chr(27)).

<b>\r</b>
	Represents "carriage return" (@CR, Chr(13)).
<b>\t</b>
	Represents "tab" (@TAB, Chr(9)).
<b>\</b><i>ddd</i>
	Represents character with octal code <i>ddd</i>, OR backreference to capturing group number <i>ddd</i> in decimal.  For example, <b>([a-z])\1</b> would match a doubled letter.
	<b>Best avoided</b> as it can be ambiguous! Favor the hex representations below.
<b>\x</b><i>hh</i>
	Represents character with hex code <i>hh</i>: "\x7E" represents a tilde, "~".
<b>\x{</b><i>hhhh</i><b>}</b>

<b><u>Groups</u></b>

Groups are used to delimit subpatterns and are the building blocks of powerful expressions.  Groups can be either capturing or not and may be nested irrespective of their nature, except comments groups.  A regular expression can contain up to 65535 capturing groups.
Option letters (discussed above) can be conveniently inserted between the "?" and the ":" of non-capturing groups: "(?-i:[aeiou]{5})" matches 5 lowercase vowels.  In this case options are local to the group.

@@ParamTable@@
<b>(</b> ... <b>)</b>
	Capturing group. The elements in the group are treated in order and can be repeated as a block.  E.g. "(ab)+c" will match "abc" or "ababc", but not "abac".
	Capturing groups remember the text they matched for use in backreferences and they populate the optionally returned array.  They are numbered starting from 1 in the order of appearance of their opening parenthesis.
	Capturing groups may also be treated as subroutines elsewhere in the pattern, possibly recursively.
<b>(?&lt;</b><i>name</i><b>&gt;</b> ... <b>)</b>
	Named capturing group. Can be later referenced by name as well as by number.  Avoid using the name "DEFINE" (see "conditional patterns").
<b>(?:</b> ... <b>)</b>
	Non-capturing group.  Does not record the matching characters in the array and cannot be re-used as backreference.
<b>(?|</b> ... <b>)</b>
	Non-capturing group with reset.  Resets capturing group numbers in each top-level alternative it contains: "(?|(Mon)|(Tue)s|(Wed)nes|(Thu)rs|(Fri)|(Sat)ur|(Sun))day" matches a weekday name and captures its abbreviation in group number 1.
<b>(?></b> ... <b>)</b>
	Atomic non-capturing group: locks and never backtracks into (gives back from) what has been matched (see also Quantifiers and greediness below).  Atomic groups, like possessive quantifiers, are always greedy.
<b>(?#</b> ... <b>)</b>
	Comment group: always ignored (but may not contain a closing parenthesis, hence comment groups are not nestable).
@@End@@


<u><b>Quantifiers and greediness</u></b>

Quantifiers (or repetition specifiers) specify how many of the preceding character, class, reference or group are expected to match.  Optional greediness qualifiers denote how aggressively the repetition will behave.  For instance "\d{3,5}" will match at least 3 and no more than 5 decimal digits.
By default, patterns are "<u>greedy</u>", which means that quantifiers <b>* + ? {</b>...<b>}</b> will match the longest string which doesn't cause the rest of the pattern to fail.  Greediness can be inverted for the entire pattern by giving option (?U) at the head of the pattern, or locally by placing a question mark following a quantifier.
Non-greedy (<u>lazy</u>) repetitions will match the smallest string that still allows the rest of the pattern to match.  E.g. given the subject "aaab", the pattern "(a*)([ab]+)" will capture "aaa" then "b", but "(?U)(a*)([ab]+)" will capture "" then "a": indeed, capturing an empty string is good enough to satisfy the lazy "(a*)" and capturing "a" matches the lazy "([ab]+)" subpattern.
Possessive quantifiers are atomic and greedy.  In fact they are a short notation for simple atomic groups.  "\d++" is a shorthand notation for "(?>\d+)" and its behavior is "match a complete sequence of one or more digits, but never give back any".  As a consequence "\d++<b>(\d</b>)" can never match since the last digit (in bold) is already matched and locked by "\d++".  This is in contrast with simple greediness, where "\d+(\d)" will first match a complete sequence of digits with "\d+", but then backtrack the last one to allow "<b>(\d)</b>" to capture it.
There are two reasons for using an atomic group or a possessive quantifier: either for matching a sequence of characters that may also appear individually (e.g. "\r\n" in the definition of <b>\R</b>), or for forcing a quick failure in certain situations involving unbounded repetitions, where the engine would normally spend a very long time trying a huge number of grouping combinations before failing.

"(?x) (?(DEFINE) (?&lt;byte&gt; 2[0-4]\d | 25[0-5] | 1\d\d | [1-9]?\d) )" defines a subroutine named "byte" which matches any component of an IPv4 address.  Then an actual address can be matched by "\b (?&amp;byte) (\.(?&amp;byte)){3} \b".
<b>(</b><i>assertion</i><b>)</b>
	Here <i>assertion</i> is one of positive or negative, look-ahead or look-behind assertion.

<u><b>General comments about PCRE regular expressions</b></u>:

	1. When UCP is active, case sense matching applies to the full Unicode plane 0.  There are also a small number of many-to-one mappings in Unicode, like the Greek lowercase letter sigma; these are supported by PCRE with UCP.

	2. Alternate forms of several escapes exist for compatibility with Perl, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, .NET and other engines.  Do not use constructs not listed here: some will simply not work, some will supply wrong results, some will cause severe issues or merely crash.
	
	3. The default newline convention is the unbreakable sequence @CRLF.

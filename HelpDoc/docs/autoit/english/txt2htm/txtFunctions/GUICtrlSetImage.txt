###Remarks###
Use a resource hacker to know the value of the valid icon name in a file.

If used on a Button control the image will be displayed on the button. Images can also be set for Checkbox controls as long as the $BS_PUSHLIKE style is used. In both case the $BS_ICON or $BS_BITMAP styles are needed to select the type of the picture used. The first icon resolution will be used in a multi icon resolution file. I.E. if a 128x128 is the first resolution and the control is 64x64 the image will be truncated.

!!! If you use this command on a TreeViewItem the first time, then all other items will use this icon/image automatically by default !!!
If you use <a href="GUICtrlSetImage.htm">GUICtrlSetImage()</a> on a TreeView or ListView then all items of it will change to this icon/image.

Passing a positive number will reference the string equivalent icon name.
Passing a negative number causes 1-based "index" behaviour. Some Dll can have icon extracted just with negative numbers.

###Function###
Random

###Description###
Generates a pseudo-random float-type number.

###Syntax###
Random ( [Min = 0 [, Max = 1 [, Flag = 0]]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
Min
	[optional] The smallest number to be generated. The default is 0.
Max
	[optional] The largest number to be generated. The default is 1.
Flag
	[optional] If this is set to 1 then an integer result will be returned.  Default is a floating point number.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	a pseudo-random number between Min and Max.
Failure:	sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If only one argument is provided, then this is interpreted to be the Max parameter.

The result will be in the range of Min to Max INCLUSIVE when using integers (just short of Max when using floats).

If Min and Max are the same value then <a href="Random.htm">Random()</a> will return 0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.

When using integers Max-Min must be less than 2^31.

<br /><strong>Comments based on the original source</strong>

This function uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator, MT19937, written by Takuji Nishimura, Makoto Matsumoto, Shawn Cokus, Matthe Bellew and Isaku Wada.

The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers. It was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators. The period, 2<sup>19937</sup>-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions, are far greater. The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.

@@ParamTable@@

	The title of the input box.
prompt
	A message to the user indicating what kind of input is expected.
default
	[optional] The value that the input box starts with.
password char
	[optional] The character to replace all typed characters with in the display. If you want the actual typed character to appear, define with an empty string ("") (default) or a space for the first character.  If you provide a multi-character string, only the first character is used for character masking.  There are special meanings for the second and subsequent characters.  See Remarks.

	[optional] The height of the window.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	the string that was entered.
Failure:	"" (empty string) and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@error	1 = The Cancel button was pushed.
	2 = The Timeout time was reached.
	3 = The InputBox failed to open. This is usually caused by bad arguments.
	4 = The InputBox cannot be displayed on any monitor.
	5 = Invalid parameters width without height or left without top.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The <a href="InputBox.htm">InputBox()</a> is user-resizable, but has a minimum size of approximately 190 x 115 pixels. Default size is approximately 250 x 190 pixels.

The string returned will not exceed 254 characters and if input contains carriage returns or linefeeds, the result will be truncated at the first occurrence of those characters.

The second and subsequent characters of the password field can be used to restrict input.  Use a space to fill the first character to still see the characters typed.  Putting an <B>M</strong> after the first character indicates that input is <u>M</u>andatory; i.e. you must enter something.  Nothing will happen if you press the <strong>Ok</strong> button when there is nothing in the <a href="InputBox.htm">InputBox()</a>.  It will not close and return the string.

You can also specify the maximum length at the end of the password field.  Just enter a number as the last character(s) to specify the length of the string.

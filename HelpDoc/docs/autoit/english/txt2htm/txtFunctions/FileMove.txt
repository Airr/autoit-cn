###Remarks###
See <a href="FileFindFirstFile.htm">FileFindFirstFile()</a> for a discussion about wildcards.

If the source and destination paths are on different volumes a copy and delete operation is performed rather than a move.

Because AutoIt lacks a "FileRename" function, use <a href="FileMove.htm">FileMove()</a> to rename a file!

The destination directory must already exist, except using with flag value $FC_CREATEPATH (8).
For instance the  combined flag $FC_OVERWRITE (1) + $FC_CREATEPATH (8) overwrites the target file and prechecks for the destination directory structure and if it doesn't exist creates it automatically.

Some file attributes can make the overwriting impossible, if this is the case look at <a href="FileSetAttrib.htm">FileSetAttrib()</a> to change the attributes of a file.

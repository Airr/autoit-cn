###Remarks###
This functions attempts to read the first standard status bar on a window (Microsoft common control: msctls_statusbar32).  Some programs use their own status bars or special versions of the MS common control which <a href="StatusbarGetText.htm">StatusbarGetText()</a> cannot read.  For example, StatusbarGetText does not work on the program TextPad; however, the first region of TextPad's status bar can be read using <a href="ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a>("TextPad", "", "HSStatusBar1")
<a href="StatusbarGetText.htm">StatusbarGetText()</a> can work on windows that are minimized or even hidden.

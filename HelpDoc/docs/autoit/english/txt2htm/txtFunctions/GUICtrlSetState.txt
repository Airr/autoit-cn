State values can be summed up as for example $GUI_DISABLE + $GUI_HIDE sets the control in an disabled and hidden state.

If an AVI control has to be hidden with $GUI_HIDE it should be closed with $GUI_AVICLOSE.

State of a "contextmenu" control <b>cannot be changed.</b>
State of a "listviewitem" control can be changed if the associated "listview" control has been created with an extended style $LVS_EX_CHECKBOXES. $GUI_FOCUS and $GUI_NOFOCUS can be used on specific listviewitem provided listview control style allows to display it : $LVS_SHOWSELALWAYS.
State of a "menu or a ""menuitem" control <b>cannot be hidden.</b>

! Important information for $GUI_EXPAND: this state is only used for TreeViewItems. If you want to use this 'action' then at least 1 Sub-TreeViewItem has to exist/created under this item !
If you want to select another item in a TreeView then you can use $GUI_FOCUS - the parent TreeView gets the window focus and the specified item is marked as selected.
If you want to set a treeview item as a default item which means painting it bold you can use $GUI_DEFBUTTON - to turn it off just use another value but $GUI_DEFBUTTON, for instance 0. This state will not be returned by <a href="GUICtrlGetState.htm">GUICtrlGetState()</a>.

If $GUI_DROPACCEPTED is set to a visible control a drag & drop can be taken in account. The edit/input control will be set with the filename.
For other controls on reception of $GUI_EVENT_DROPPED, @GUI_DragId will return the controlID from where the drag start (-1 if from a file, @GUI_DragFile contain the filename being dropped) and @GUI_DropId returns the controlID of the dropped control.
Only dragging a ListviewItem will start the drag & drop process. The @GUI_DragId will be the ListView controlID.

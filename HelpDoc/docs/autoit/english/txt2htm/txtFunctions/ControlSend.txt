###Remarks###
<a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend()</a> works in a similar way to <a href="Send.htm">Send()</a> but it can send key strokes directly to a window/control, rather than just to the active window.

<a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend()</a> is only unreliable for command prompts as that works differently to normal windows (seems to check physical states rather than accepting the keystroke messages).  For normal windows <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend()</a> should be way more reliable than a normal <a href="Send.htm">Send()</a> - and yes it does send shift, ctrl, alt etc.

As mention in the <a href="Send.htm">Send()</a> help the keyboard that send different chars when in CAPS LOCK and using the Shift Key cannot be simulated. An example is the Czech Keyboard. A good workaround is to use the <a href="ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText()</a>.

The control might first need to be given focus with the <a href="ControlFocus.htm">ControlFocus()</a> command, specially when referencing an controlID created by the script itself.

<a href="AutoItSetOption.htm">Opt</a>("SendKeyDelay",...) alters the length of the brief pause in between sent keystrokes.
<a href="AutoItSetOption.htm">Opt</a>("SendKeyDownDelay",...) alters the length of time a key is held down before being released during a keystroke.

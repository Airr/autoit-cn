	$aArray[1][0] = 1st Process name
	$aArray[1][1] = 1st Process ID (PID)
	$aArray[2][0] = 2nd Process name
	$aArray[2][1] = 2nd Process ID (PID)
	...
	$aArray[n][0] = nth Process name
	$aArray[n][1] = nth Process ID (PID)

The list can be empty if $aArray[0][0] = 0. No @error set in this case.

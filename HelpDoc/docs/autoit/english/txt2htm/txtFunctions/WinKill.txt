@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
None.  (Always returns 1 regardless of success.)


###Remarks###
The difference between this function and <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose()</a> is that <a href="WinKill.htm">WinKill()</a> will forcibly terminate the window if it doesn't close quickly enough.  Consequently, a user might not have time to respond to dialogs prompting the user to save data.  Although <a href="WinKill.htm">WinKill()</a> can work on both minimized and hidden windows, some windows (notably explorer windows) can only be terminated using <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose()</a>.

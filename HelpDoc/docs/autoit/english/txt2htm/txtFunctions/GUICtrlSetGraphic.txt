$GUI_GR_COLOR	Color [,BkColor]	Define the color of the next drawings. When BkColor is equal to $GUI_GR_NOBKCOLOR the drawing will not be filled. It is the default. For Color the default line color is black.
$GUI_GR_MOVE	x,y	Move the current position without drawing.
$GUI_GR_DOT	x,y	Draw a point(smallest square around the point), the next drawing will start from previous position.
$GUI_GR_PIXEL	x,y	Draw a pixel, the next drawing will start from previous position.
$GUI_GR_LINE	x,y	Draw a line.
$GUI_GR_BEZIER	x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2	Draw a bezier curve with 2 control points.
$GUI_GR_RECT	x,y,w,h	Draw a rectangle. If w=h it will be a square.
$GUI_GR_ELLIPSE	x,y,w,h	Draw an ellipse. If w=h it will be a circle.
$GUI_GR_PIE	x,y,r,sa,wa	Draw a pie radius=r startangle=sa sweepangle=wa. Angles are in degrees.
$GUI_GR_CLOSE	&nbsp;	to close the current drawing. It has to be added to $GUI_GR_LINE or $GUI_GR_BEZIER to close current drawing. Use alone will be ignored.
$GUI_GR_REFRESH	&nbsp;	to force refresh after dynamic update of graphics.
$GUI_GR_HINT	&nbsp;	to display control point and end point of bezier/line curve.
$GUI_GR_PENSIZE	n	set pensize for the next drawings. It has to be defined before $GUI_GR_COLOR to be taken in account.
$GUI_GR_NOBKCOLOR	&nbsp;	is a dummy BkColor to force closed drawing not to be filled. Just line drawings.

Due to design constraints RECT, ELLIPSE and PIE graphics are drawn first.  For example, a LINE will always be drawn over a RECT.  If the drawing order is important to the look of the graphic, then it is recommended that multiple graphic controls be used instead of using a single control to do all the drawing.

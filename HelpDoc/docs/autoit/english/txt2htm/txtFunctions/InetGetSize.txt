###Remarks###
Internet Explorer 3 or greater must be installed for this function to work.  (For ftp:// URLs IE 5 is required!)

The URL parameter should be in the form "http://www.somesite.com/path/file.html" - just like an address you would type into your web browser.

To use a username and password when connecting simply prefix the servername with "username:password@", e.g.
"http://myuser:mypassword@www.somesite.com"

Not all servers will correctly give the file size, especially when using a proxy server.

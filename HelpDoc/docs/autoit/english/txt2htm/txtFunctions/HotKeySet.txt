###ReturnValue###

Success:	Returns 1.
Failure:	Returns 0.

###Remarks###
It is better to use the lower keyboard key as for keyboard as Russian one, the unshifted key is not the lower value. I.E. "D" is not the upper case of "B". The Hotkey will not be set and a failure will occur.

If two AutoIt scripts set the same HotKeys, you should avoid running those scripts simultaneously.  (The second script cannot capture the hotkey unless the first script terminates or unregisters the key prior to the second script setting the hotkey.)

A hotkey-press *typically* interrupts the active AutoIt function/statement and runs its user function until it completes or is interrupted.  Exceptions are as follows:
1)  If the current function is a "blocking" function, then the key-presses are buffered and execute as soon as the blocking function completes.  <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox()</a> and <a href="FileSelectFolder.htm">FileSelectFolder()</a> are examples of blocking functions.  Try the behavior of Shift-Alt-d in the Example.
2)  If you have paused the script by clicking on the AutoIt Tray icon, any hotkeys pressed during this paused state are ignored.

<b>The following hotkeys cannot be set:</b>

When you set a hotkey, AutoIt captures the key-press and does not pass it on to the active application, with one exception:  the Lock keys (NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock) still toggle their respective state!
To <a href="Send.htm">Send()</a> a key combination which will trigger a <a href="HotKeySet.htm">HotKeySet()</a> event, either use <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend()</a> or unregister the <a href="HotKeySet.htm">HotKeySet()</a> event, otherwise, the <a href="Send.htm">Send()</a> event may trigger an infinite loop.

The called function can <b>not</b> be given parameters. They will be ignored.

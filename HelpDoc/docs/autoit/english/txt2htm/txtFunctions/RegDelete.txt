A registry key must start with "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" ("HKLM") or "HKEY_USERS" ("HKU") or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER" ("HKCU") or "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT" ("HKCR") or "HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG" ("HKCC").

When running on 64-bit Windows if you want to delete a key or value specific to the 64-bit environment you have to suffix the HK... with 64 i.e. HKLM64.

To access the <strong>(Default)</strong> value use <strong>""</strong> (an empty string) for the valuename.

Deleting from the registry is potentially dangerous--please exercise caution!

It is possible to access remote registries by using a keyname in the form "\\computername\keyname".  To use this feature you must have the correct access rights.

$tagNMDATETIMEFORMAT

###Description###

		"short Hour;short Minute;short Second;short MSecond;ptr pDisplay;char Display[64]"

pDisplay
	Pointer to a null terminated string that contains the display text of the control. By default, this
	is the address of the Display member of this structure. It is acceptable to have pDisplay point to an
	existing string. In this case, you don't need to assign a value to Display. However, the string that pDisplay
	points to must remain valid until another $DTN_FORMAT notification is sent or until the control is destroyed.
Display
	64 character buffer that is to receive the null terminated string that the control will display. It
	is not necessary to fill the entire buffer.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
It carries the string that defines the callback field and contains a buffer to receive the string that will
be displayed in the callback field. This structure is used with the $DTN_FORMAT notification message.

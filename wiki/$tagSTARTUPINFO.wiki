###Fields###
@@ParamTable@@
Size
	The size of the structure, in bytes
Reserved1
	Reserved, must be zero
Desktop
	The name of the desktop, or the name of both the desktop and window station for this process
Title
	For console processes, the title displayed in the title bar if a new console is created
X
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USEPOSITION, this member is the x offset of the upper left corner
	of a window if a new window is created, in pixels.
Y
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USEPOSITION, this member is the y offset of the upper left corner
	of a window if a new window is created, in pixels.
XSize
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESIZE, this member is the height of the window, in pixels
YSize
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESIZE, this member is the width of the window, in pixels
XCountChars
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USECOUNTCHARS, if a new console window is created in a console
	process, this member specifies the screen buffer width, in character columns.
YCountChars
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USECOUNTCHARS, if a new console window is created in a console
	process, this member specifies the screen buffer height, in character rows.
FillAttribute
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USEFILLATTRIBUTE, this member is the initial text and background
	colors if a new console window is created in a console application.
Flags
	Determines which members are used when the process creates a window:
		$STARTF_FORCEONFEEDBACK - The cursor is in feedback mode for two seconds after CreateProcess is called. The
	Working in Background cursor is displayed. If during those two seconds the process makes the first GUI call,
	the system gives five more seconds to the process. If during those five seconds the process shows a window,
	the system gives five more seconds to the process to finish drawing the window. The system turns the feedback
	cursor off after the first call to GetMessage, regardless of whether the process is drawing.
		$STARTF_FORCEOFFFEEDBACK - Indicates that the feedback cursor is forced off while the process is starting.
	The Normal Select cursor is displayed.
		$STARTF_RUNFULLSCREEN - Indicates that the process should be run in full screen mode, rather than in
	windowed mode. This flag is only valid for console applications running on an x86 computer.
		$STARTF_USECOUNTCHARS - The XCountChars and YCountChars members are valid
		$STARTF_USEFILLATTRIBUTE - The FillAttribute member is valid
		$STARTF_USEPOSITION - The X and Y members are valid
		$STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW - The ShowWindow member is valid
		$STARTF_USESIZE - The XSize and YSize members are valid
		$STARTF_USESTDHANDLES - The hStdInput, hStdOutput, and hStdError members are valid
ShowWindow
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW, this member can be any of the SW_ constants
Reserved2
	Reserved, must be zero
Reserved3
	Reserved, must be zero
StdInput
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this member is the standard input handle
StdOutput
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this member is the standard output handle
StdError
	If Flags specifies $STARTF_USESTDHANDLES, this member is the standard error handle

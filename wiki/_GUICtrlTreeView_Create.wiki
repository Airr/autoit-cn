@@ParamTable@@
$hParent
	Handle to parent or owner window
$iX
	Horizontal position of the control
$iY
	Vertical position of the control
$iWidth
	Control width
$iHeight
	Control height
$iStyle
	Control style:
		DllStructGetData($TVS_CHECKBOXES - Enables check boxes for items, "") A check box will be displayed only if an image is
		associated with the item. When set to this style, the control effectively uses DrawFrameControl to create and
		set a state image list containing two images. State image 1 is the unchecked box and state image 2 is the
		checked box. Setting the state image to zero removes the check box. Version 5.80 displays a check box even
		if no image is associated with the item.
		$TVS_DISABLEDRAGDROP - Prevents the control from sending $TVN_BEGINDRAG notification messages
		$TVS_EDITLABELS - Allows the user to edit the item labels
		DllStructGetData($TVS_FULLROWSELECT - Enables full row selection, "") The entire row of the selected item is highlighted, and
		clicking anywhere on an item's row causes it to be selected. This style cannot be used in conjunction with
		the DllStructGetData($TVS_HASLINES style, "")
		DllStructGetData($TVS_HASBUTTONS - Displays plus and minus buttons next to parent items, "") The user clicks the buttons to
		expand or collapse a parent item's list of child items. To include buttons with items at the root, you must
		also specify DllStructGetData($TVS_LINESATROOT, "")
		$TVS_HASLINES - Uses lines to show the hierarchy of items
		$TVS_INFOTIP - Obtains ToolTip information by sending the $TVN_GETINFOTIP notification
		DllStructGetData($TVS_LINESATROOT - Uses lines to link items at the root of the control, "") This value is ignored if
		DllStructGetData($TVS_HASLINES is not also specified, "")
		DllStructGetData($TVS_NOHSCROLL - Disables horizontal scrolling in the control, "") The control will not display any
		horizontal scroll bars.
		DllStructGetData($TVS_NONEVENHEIGHT - Sets the height of the items to an odd height with the $TVM_SETITEMHEIGHT message, "") By
		default the height of items must be an even value.
		DllStructGetData($TVS_NOSCROLL - Disables both horizontal and vertical scrolling in the control, "") The control will not
		display any scroll bars.
		$TVS_NOTOOLTIPS - Disables ToolTips
		$TVS_RTLREADING - Causes text to be displayed from right to left
		$TVS_SHOWSELALWAYS - Causes a selected item to remain selected when the control loses focus
		$TVS_SINGLEEXPAND - Causes the item being selected to expand and the item being unselected to collapse
		upon selection. If the mouse is used to single-click the selected item and that item is closed, it will be
		expanded. If the user holds down the CTRL key while selecting an item, the item being unselected will not be
		collapsed. Version 5.80 causes the item being selected to expand and the item being unselected to collapse
		upon selection. If the user holds down the CTRL key while selecting an item, the item being unselected will
		not be collapsed.
		$TVS_TRACKSELECT - Enables hot tracking

		Default: $TVS_HASBUTTONS, $TVS_HASLINES, $TVS_LINESATROOT, $TVS_DISABLEDRAGDROP, $TVS_SHOWSELALWAYS
		Forced: $WS_CHILD, $WS_VISIBLE

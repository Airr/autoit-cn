  <h1>SciTE Jump</h1>

  <h2>What is SciTE Jump?</h2>

  <p>SciTE Jump offers a quick and efficient way to jump between
  functions without having to scroll through an entire script to
  find the particular function you're looking for.<br>
  <br>
  SciTE Jump comes with a host of additional features such as
  searching for a keyword within AutoIt files, exporting the
  functions to a list or convert AutoIt code to HTML syntax.</p>

  <h2>How do I get SciTE Jump?</h2>

  <p>SciTE Jump is available with the full version of <a href=
  "http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-script-editor/" target=
  "_blank">SciTE4AutoIt3</a>, therefore in SciTE you can either
  navigate to <strong>Tools &gt;&gt; SciTE Jump</strong> or hit the
  key combination <strong>Ctrl + Alt + J</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  If a new version is available from the official site <a href=
  "http://softwarespot.wordpress.com/code/scite-jump/" target=
  "_blank">(SoftwareSpot)</a> and hasn't been updated in <a href=
  "http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-script-editor/" target=
  "_blank">SciTE4AutoIt3</a>, then download the latest version and
  select 'Yes' when asked would you like to upgrade.</p>

  <h2>How to use?</h2>

  <p>To use SciTE Jump is very simple, select a function
  <em>(3)</em> to immediately navigate to the particular function
  in the script. If you wish to get back to the top of the script
  then select the item 'Functions'.<br>
  <br>
  Search for functions <em>(1)</em> in the functions list or search
  within AutoIt files for a particular keyword <em>(2)</em>, useful
  if you have a lot of functions spread across many folders. To
  search for a keyword either select the folder button or by
  dropping the folder onto SciTE Jump and then hit the
  'Enter/Return' key, previous folders are saved in the dropdown
  menu. To get back to the default view select the 'Refresh'
  button.<br>
  <br>
  Navigate to a certain line number in the script <em>(4)</em> by
  typing in the appropriate field, the line number is automatically
  jumped to whilst you type.<br>
  To change the interface language or to restart both SciTE and
  SciTE Jump can be done so by selecting the title bar icon.<br>
  <br>

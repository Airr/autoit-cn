###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
文件名
	要包含到当前脚本的文件名. 路径是可选的.(如果该包含文件与脚本处于同一文件夹下或者处于AU3的包含目录). <b>文件名必须是字符串,不能是一个变量.</b>
	If <b>"..."</b> is used, the filename is taken to be relative to the current script.
	If <b>&lt;...&gt;</b> is used the filename is taken to be relative to include library directory (usually C:\Program Files\AutoIt3\Include).  The include library contains many pre-written user-functions for you to use!

###Remarks###
在 AutoIt 的脚本中,可通过 "#include" 命令包含其它脚本文件.

For the include library syntax (#include &lt;file&gt;) to work AutoIt must have been installed using the supplied installer otherwise the installation directory will not be known and the current script directory (@ScriptDir\Include) will be used instead.

If you include the same file containing a user-function more than once you will get a "Duplicate function" error.  When writing an include file that may be used in this way, make sure that the top line contains <b>#include-once</b> to prevent that file from being included more than once.

There is a special registry value that can be created at "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AutoIt v3\AutoIt" called "Include".  It should be a REG_SZ (string) value.  The contents of this value are a semi-colon delimited list of directories that should be searched for files when resolving #include's in addition to the standard locations.

The search order used by AutoIt depends on which form of #include you use.  The tables below show the order directories are searched using both forms.

使用 #include <>

A note about using the /AutoIt3ExecuteScript option.  Since the standard library is searched for in the current interpreter's directory, the standard library functions will not be found; that library will only be found when run through AutoIt3.exe.  It's recommended that you compile a script to the .a3x format before attempting to run it with /AutoIt3ExecuteScript.

Aut2Exe uses the same algorithm as AutoIt3.exe with the only difference being it looks for the Include sub-directory as being in a sibling directory to itself (..\Include).

If Opt("TrayIconDebug",1) only 64 include files name can be displayed in the traytooltip. for the other no filename will be displayed.

<p>AutoIt is a 'growing' scripting language.&nbsp; It started as an add-on tool to 
automate basic tasks in GUI's of other programs. <br>
These tasks (like sending a keystroke or clicking a button) are still the core 
components of an AutoIt script. However with the recent GUI additions, you can 
now incorporate your own graphical interface using native AutoIt script 
commands.<br>
The new COM (Object) functionality fills the gap with WSH languages, such as 
VBScript/JScript.<br>
<br>
With this combination of GUI Automation, GUI Interfaces and COM support, AutoIt 
offers you a powerful scripting tool that is able to compete with fully-fledged 
scripting languages like WSH or KiXStart).</p>

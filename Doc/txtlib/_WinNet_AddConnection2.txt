###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sLocalName
	Name of a local device to be redirected, such as "F:" or "LPT1". The string is treated in a
		case-insensitive manner. If 0, a connection to the network resource is made without redirecting the local
		device.
$sRemoteName
	Name of the network resource to connect to
$sUsername
	User name for making the connection. If 0, the function uses the default user name.
$sPassword
	Password to be used to make a connection. If 0, the default password is used. If the string is
		empty, no password is used.
$iType
	Specifies the type of network resource to connect to:
		0 - Any (only if $sLocalName is 0)
		1 - Disk
		2 - Print
$iOptions
	Connection options. Can be one or more of the following:
		 1 - The network resource connection should be remembered
		 2 - The operating system may interact with the user for authentication purposes
		 4 - The system not to use any default setting for user names or passwords without offering the user the
		opportunity to supply an alternative. This flag is ignored unless bit 2 (interactive) is also set.
		 8 - Forces the redirection of a local device when making the connection
		16 - The operating system prompts the user for authentication using the command line instead of a GUI. This
		flag is ignored unless bit 2 (interactive) is also set.
		32 - If this bit is set, and the operating system prompts for a credential, the credential is saved by the
		credential manager. If the credential manager is disabled for the caller's logon session, or if the network
		provider does not support saving credentials, this flag is ignored. This flag is also ignored unless you set
		bit 5 (command line instead of GUI).

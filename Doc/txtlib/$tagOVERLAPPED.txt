###Structure Name###
$tagOVERLAPPED

###Description###
Contains information used in asynchronous (or overlapped) input and output (I/O).

###Syntax###
Global Const $tagOVERLAPPED = "int Internal;int InternalHigh;int Offset;int OffsetHigh;int hEvent"

###Fields###
@@ParamTable@@
Internal
	Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies a system-dependent status, is
	valid when the GetOverlappedResult function returns without setting the extended error information to
	ERROR_IO_PENDING.
InternalHigh
	Reserved for operating system use. This member, which specifies the length of the data
	transferred, is valid when the GetOverlappedResult function returns True.
Offset
	File position at which to start the transfer. The file position is a byte offset from the start
	of the file. The calling process must set this member before calling the ReadFile or WriteFile function. This
	member is used only when the device is a file. Otherwise, this member must be zero.
OffsetHigh
	High-order word of the file position at which to start the transfer. This member is used only
	when the device is a file. Otherwise, this member must be zero.
hEvent
	Handle to an event that will be set to the signaled state when the operation has completed. The
	calling process must set this member either to zero or a valid event handle before calling any overlapped
	functions.

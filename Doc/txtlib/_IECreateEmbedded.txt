###Remarks###
No actions can be performed on this object until it has been embedded into a parent application (e.g. you cannot perform an _IENavigate).  Because of this restriction, the browser is not automatically navigated to 'about:blank' as is a browser created with _IECreate.  You must therefore use _IENavigate to navigate this browser to 'about:blank' after it has been embedded into the parent application and before you attempt any operations that rely on having a document loaded (e.g. _IEBodyWriteHTML).

There are several properties related to an InternetExplorer object (e.g. returned by _IECreate) that do not apply to this object.  These include status text, addressbar and others that may exist for a browser, but do not exist for an embedded control.

You may have object visibility issues unless you use the Windows style $WS_CLIPCHILDREN in GUICreate().

_IEQuit cannot be used with this object.  The object will be destroyed when its parent GUI is destroyed.

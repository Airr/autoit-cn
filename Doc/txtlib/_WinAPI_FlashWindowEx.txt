###Remarks###
Typically, you flash a window to inform the user that the window requires attention but does not currently
have the keyboard focus. When a window flashes, it appears to change from inactive to active status. An
inactive caption bar changes to an active caption bar; an active caption bar changes to an inactive caption
bar.

@@ParamTable@@
$sFileName
	Names a Win32 executable module (either a .DLL or an .EXE file). The name specified is the
		filename of the executable module.
$iFlags
	Specifies the action to take when loading the module. This parameter can be one of the
		following values:
		$DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES - If this value is used and the executable module is a DLL the system does
		not call DllMain for process and thread initialization and termination. Also, the system does not load
		additional executable modules that are referenced by the specified module.
		$LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE - If this value is used, the system maps the file into the calling process's
		address space as if it were a data file. Nothing is done to execute or prepare to execute the mapped file.
		$LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH - If this value is used, and $FileName specifies a path, the system uses the
		alternate file search strategy to find the associated executable modules that the specified module causes to
		be loaded.

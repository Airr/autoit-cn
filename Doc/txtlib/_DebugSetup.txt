###User Defined Function###
_DebugSetup

###Description###

###Syntax###

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sTitle
	(Optional) Title to put on the Notepad window used by _DebugOut().
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns 1.
Failure:	Sets @Error and returns 0.
@Error:	0 = No error.
	1 = $sTitle is not a compatible type
	2 = A debug session is already open.  Use it instead of starting a new session.
	3 = Another Untitled MS-Notepad window is open.  Save it or close it before continuing.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
You can only start one debug session at a time in the running script.  Attempting to call _DebugSetup() when another debug Notepad session is still open will cause @Error = 2, but _DebugOut() will continue to operate, using the original session.  If the Notepad window is closed, _DebugSetup will need to be called to restart the debug Notepad session.
You can debug several concurrent scripts using the same Notepad session, just use the same $sTitle when calling _DebugSetup(). All _DebugOut() will go to the same Notepad session.

If an untitled Notepad session is already open when calling this function, the script may not be able to tell the difference between your Notepad session and the one it starts, so it may abort with @Error = 3, if this is the situation.  Notepad sessions can be started without any confusion after _DebugSetup() returns.

Commenting out the _DebugSetup() call will effectively disable all the calls to _DebugOut(), but you may want to remove the calls to all _Debug functions before making a release version of your script.

	Specifies the version of Microsoft Windows GDI+
Callback
	Pointer to a callback function that GDI+ can call, on debug builds, for assertions and warnings
NoThread
	Boolean value that specifies whether to suppress the GDI+ background thread. If you set this member
	to True, GdiplusStartup returns a pointer to a hook function and a pointer to an unhook function. You must
	call those functions appropriately to replace the background thread. If you do not want to be responsible for
	calling the hook and unhook functions, set this member to False.
NoCodecs
	Boolean value that specifies whether you want GDI+ to suppress external image codecs. GDI+ version
	1.0 does not support external image codecs, so this parameter is ignored.

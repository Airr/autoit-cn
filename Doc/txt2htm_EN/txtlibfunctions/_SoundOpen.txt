###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns a 4-element array containing the following information:
	$array[0] = Sound file ID string
	$array[1] = VBR length correction factor
	$array[2] = VBR timing correction factor
	$array[3] = Sound ID marker
Failure:	0 and set @error
@error:	1 = MCI open error
	2 = File does not exist
@Extended:	0 = No Error
	Integer other than 0 = MCI Error

###Remarks###
Although many of the _Sound functions will accept the filename as a parameter, if there is a possibility of the file being VBR (variable bit rate) encoded it is highly recommended to use _SoundOpen initially and then use the returned array as the identity parameter in other _Sound...() functions.  This is because because the MCI DLL assumes all files are CBR (constant bit rate) encoded and produces incorrect results from those _Sound...() functions dealing with length and position when the sound file has been VBR (variable bit rate) encoded.  If using the array as the ID parameter with the _Sound...() functions which alter the VBR correction factors (_SoundStop) the ID array will be updated when needed. 
The individual elements of the returned array have no utility outside the _Sound functions and their internal use is transparent to the user.

		$TVIF_EXPANDEDIMAGE - The iExpandedImage member is valid (IE Version 6.00 and Windows Vista)
		$TVIF_HANDLE - The hItem member is valid
		$TVIF_IMAGE - The Image member is valid
		$TVIF_INTEGRAL - The Integral member is valid
		$TVIF_PARAM - The Param member is valid
		$TVIF_SELECTEDIMAGE - The SelectedImage member is valid
		$TVIF_STATE - The State and StateMask members are valid
		$TVIF_STATEEX - The uStateEx member is valid (IE Version 6.00 and Windows Vista) 
		$TVIF_TEXT - The Text and TextMax members are valid
hItem
	Item to which this structure refers
State
	Set of bit flags and image list indexes that indicate the item's state. When setting the state
	of an item, the StateMask member indicates the bits of this member that are valid. When retrieving the state
	of an item, this member returns the current state for the bits indicated in the StateMask member. Bits 0
	through 7 of this member contain the item state flags. Bits 8 through 11 of this member specify the one based
	overlay image index.
StateMask
	Bits of the state member that are valid. If you are retrieving an item's state, set the bits
	of the stateMask member to indicate the bits to be returned in the state member. If you are setting an item's
	state, set the bits of the stateMask member to indicate the bits of the state member that you want to set.
Text
	Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the item text.
TextMax
	Size of the buffer pointed to by the Text member, in characters
Image
	Index in the image list of the icon image to use when the item is in the nonselected state
SelectedImage
	Index in the image list of the icon image to use when the item is in the selected state
Children
	Flag that indicates whether the item has associated child items. This member can be one of the
	following values:
		0 - The item has no child items
		1 - The item has one or more child items
Param
	A value to associate with the item
Integral
	Height of the item
uStateEx
	One or more (as a bitwise combination) of the following extended states.
	Value Meaning:
		TVIS_EX_DISABLED Windows Vista and later. Creates a control that is drawn in grey, that the user cannot interact with.
		TVIS_EX_FLAT Creates a flat item—the item is virtual and is not visible in the tree; instead, its children take its place in the tree hierarchy.
		TVIS_EX_HWND Creates a separate HWND for the item.
hwnd
	Not used; must be NULL.
iExpandedImage
	Index of the image in the control's image list to display when the item is in the expanded state.
iReserved
	Reserved member. Do not use.

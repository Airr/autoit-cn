###Remarks###
Your initial registration for restart must occur before the application encounters an unhandled exception
or becomes unresponsive. You could then call this function from inside your recovery callback to update the
command line. To prevent cyclical restarts, the system will only restart the application if it has been
running for a minimum of 60 seconds.

If you register for restart and the application encounters an unhandled exception or is not responsive,
the user is offered the opportunity to restart the applicationthe application is not automatically restarted
without the user's consent.

This function requires Windows Vista or later.

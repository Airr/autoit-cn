###Remarks###
The path, if it is to be drawn by this function, must have been completed through a call to _WinAPI_EndPath().
Unlike other path drawing functions such as _WinAPI_StrokeAndFillPath(), _WinAPI_StrokePath() will not attempt
to close the path by drawing a straight line from the first point on the path to the last point on the path.

Flags
	Type of search to perform. This member can be set to one or more of the following values:
		$LVFI_PARAM - Searches for a match between this structure's Param member and the Param member of an item. If $LVFI_PARAM is specified, all other flags are ignored.
		$LVFI_PARTIAL - Checks to see if the item text begins with the string pointed to by the Text member. This value implies use of $LVFI_STRING.
		$LVFI_STRING - Searches based on the item text. Unless additional values are specified, the item text of the matching item must exactly match the string pointed to by the Text member.
		$LVFI_SUBSTRING - Equivalent to $LVFI_PARTIAL (Windows Vista and Later).
		$LVFI_WRAP - Continues the search at the beginning if no match is found
		$LVFI_NEARESTXY - Finds the item nearest to the position specified in the X and Y members, in the direction specified by the Direction member. This flag is supported only by large icon and small icon modes.
Text
	Address of a string to compare with the item text. It is valid if $LVFI_STRING or $LVFI_PARTIAL
	is set in the Flags member.
Param
	Value to compare with the Param member of an item's $LVITEM structure. It is valid only if
	$LVFI_PARAM is set in the flags member.
$tagPOINT
	Initial X,Y search position. It is valid only if $LVFI_NEARESTXY is set in the Flags member.
Direction
	Virtual key code that specifies the direction to search. The following codes are supported:
		VK_LEFT
		VK_RIGHT
		VK_UP
		VK_DOWN
		VK_HOME
		VK_END
		VK_PRIOR
		VK_NEXT
		This member is valid only if $LVFI_NEARESTXY is set in the flags member.

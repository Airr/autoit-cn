###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_GetAsyncKeyState

###Description###
Determines whether a key is up or down at the time the function is called.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_GetAsyncKeyState ( $vKey )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$vKey
	The virtual-key code ($VK_*).
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	If the 16th (15) bit is set, the key is down, and if the 1st (0) bit is set, the key was pressed
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
Although the least significant bit of the return value indicates whether the key has been pressed since the last
query, due to the pre-emptive multitasking nature of Windows, another application can call _WinAPI_GetAsyncKeyState()
and receive the "recently pressed" bit instead of your application.

You can use the virtual-key code constants $VK_SHIFT, $VK_CONTROL, and $VK_MENU as values for the $vKey parameter.
This gives the state of the SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT keys without distinguishing between left and right.

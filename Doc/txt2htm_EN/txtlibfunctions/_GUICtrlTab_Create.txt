	[optional] Control styles:
		$TCS_BOTTOM - Tabs appear at the bottom of the control
		$TCS_BUTTONS - Tabs appear as buttons, and no border is drawn around the display area
		$TCS_FIXEDWIDTH - All tabs are the same width
		$TCS_FLATBUTTONS - Selected tabs appear as being indented into the background while other tabs appear
		as being on the same plane as the background. This only affects tab controls with the $TCS_BUTTONS style.
		$TCS_FOCUSNEVER - The control does not receive the input focus when clicked
		$TCS_FOCUSONBUTTONDOWN - The control receives the input focus when clicked
		$TCS_FORCEICONLEFT - Icons are aligned with the left edge of each fixed width tab. This style can only be
		used with the $TCS_FIXEDWIDTH style.
		$TCS_FORCELABELLEFT - Labels are aligned on the left edge of each fixed width tab. The label is displayed
		immediately to the right of the icon instead of being centered. This style can only be used with the
		$TCS_FIXEDWIDTH style and it implies the $TCS_FORCEICONLEFT style.
		$TCS_HOTTRACK - Items under the pointer are automatically highlighted. You can check whether or not
		hot tracking is enabled by calling SystemParametersInfo.
		$TCS_MULTILINE - Multiple rows of tabs are displayed, if necessary, so all tabs are visible at once
		$TCS_MULTISELECT - Multiple tabs can be selected by holding down the CTRL key when clicking. This style
		must be used with the $TCS_BUTTONS style.
		$TCS_OWNERDRAWFIXED - The parent window is responsible for drawing tabs
		$TCS_RAGGEDRIGHT - Rows of tabs will not be stretched to fill the entire width of the control. This
		style is the default.
		$TCS_RIGHT - Tabs appear vertically on the right side of controls that use the $TCS_VERTICAL
		style. This value equals $TCS_BOTTOM. This style is not supported if you use visual styles.
		$TCS_RIGHTJUSTIFY - The width of each tab is increased, if necessary, so that each row of tabs fills the
		entire width of the tab control. This style is ignored unless the $TCS_MULTILINE style is also specified.
		$TCS_SCROLLOPPOSITE - Unneeded tabs scroll to the opposite side of the control when a tab is selected
		$TCS_SINGLELINE - Only one row of tabs is displayed. The user can scroll to see more tabs, if
		necessary. This style is the default.
		$TCS_TABS - Tabs appear as tabs, and a border is drawn around the display area. This style is
		the default.
		$TCS_TOOLTIPS - The tab control has a ToolTip control associated with it
		$TCS_VERTICAL - Tabs appear at the left side of the control with tab text displayed vertically. This
		style is valid only when used with the $TCS_MULTILINE style. To make tabs appear on the right side of the
		control, also use the $TCS_RIGHT style.

		Default: $TCS_HOTTRACK
		Forced: $WS_CHILD, $WS_CLIPSIBLINGS, $WS_VISIBLE
$iExStyle
	[optional] Control extended styles:
		$TCS_EX_FLATSEPARATORS - The control will draw separators between the tab items

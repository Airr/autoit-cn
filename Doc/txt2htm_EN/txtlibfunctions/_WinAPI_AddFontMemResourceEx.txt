###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_AddFontMemResourceEx

###Description###
Adds the font resource from a memory image to the system.

_WinAPI_AddFontMemResourceEx ( $pData, $iSize )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$pData
	The pointer to a font resource.

@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The handle uniquely identifies the fonts that were installed on the system, @extended flag will contain
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
This function allows an application to get a font that is embedded in a document or a Web page. A font that is
added by this is always private to the process that made the call and is not enumerable.

When the function succeeds, the caller of this function can free the memory pointed to by $pData because the system
has made its own copy of the memory. To remove the fonts that were installed, call _WinAPI_RemoveFontMemResourceEx().
However, when the process goes away, the system will unload the fonts.

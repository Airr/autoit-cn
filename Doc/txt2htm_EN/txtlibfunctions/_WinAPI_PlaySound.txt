@@ParamTable@@
$sSound
	The string that specifies the sound to play. The maximum length is 255 characters. If $sSound is
	empty, any currently playing waveform sound is stopped.
$iFlags
	[可选参数] The flags for sound playing. This parameter can be one or more of the following values.
	
	$SND_APPLICATION
	$SND_ALIAS
	$SND_ALIAS_ID
	$SND_ASYNC
	$SND_FILENAME
	$SND_LOOP
	$SND_MEMORY
	$SND_NODEFAULT
	$SND_NOSTOP
	$SND_NOWAIT
	$SND_PURGE
	$SND_RESOURCE
	$SND_SYNC
	
	Windows Vista or later
	
	$SND_SENTRY
	$SND_SYSTEM
	
	Three flags ($SND_ALIAS, $SND_FILENAME, and $SND_RESOURCE) determine whether the name is interpreted
	as an alias for a system event, a file name, or a resource identifier. If none of these flags are
	specified, _WinAPI_PlaySound() searches the registry or the WIN.INI file for an association with
	the specified sound name. If an association is found, the sound event is played. If no association
	is found in the registry, the name is interpreted as a file name.
	
	If the $SND_ALIAS_ID flag is specified in $iFlags, the $sSound parameter must be one of the
	$SND_ALIAS_* values.
	
	(See MSDN for more information)
	
$hInstance
	[可选参数] Handle to the executable file that contains the resource to be loaded. If $iFlags does not
	contain the $SND_RESOURCE, this parameter will be ignored.

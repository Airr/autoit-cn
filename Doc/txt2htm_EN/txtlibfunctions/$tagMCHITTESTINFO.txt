Size
	Size of this structure, in bytes
$tagPOINT 
	X,Y position of the point to be hit tested
Hit
	Results of the hit test operation. This value will be one of the following:
		$MCHT_CALENDARBK - The given point was in the calendar's background
		$MCHT_CALENDARDATE - The given point was on a particular date within the calendar
		$MCHT_CALENDARDATENEXT - The given point was over a date from the next month

		$MCHT_CALENDARDAY - The given point was over a day abbreviation
		$MCHT_CALENDARWEEKNUM - The given point was over a week number
		$MCHT_NOWHERE - The given point was not on the month calendar control
		$MCHT_TITLEBK - The given point was over the background of a month's title
		$MCHT_TITLEBTNNEXT - The given point was over the button at the top right corner
		$MCHT_TITLEBTNPREV - The given point was over the button at the top left corner
		$MCHT_TITLEMONTH - The given point was in a month's title bar, over a month name

$tagSYSTEMTIME 
	Year
	Month
	DOW
	Day
	Hour
	Minute
	Seconds
	MSeconds
$tagRECT
	The RECT of the hit-tested location.
iOffset
	When displaying more than one calendar, this is the offset of the calendar at the hit-tested point (zero-based).
iRow
	The row number for the calendar grid that the given hit point was over. Example: If you hit-tested the 8th of a month, which is in the second week of the month, iRow will be one since the index of the row is zero-based row index.
iCol
	The column number for the calendar grid that the given point was over. For example, if your week starts on Sunday and the 1st of the month is Friday, hit testing the 1st will return five (5) for iCol, since Friday is in the fifth column from the beginning of the row, using a zero-based column index.

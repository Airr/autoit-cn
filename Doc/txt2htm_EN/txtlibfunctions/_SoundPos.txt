###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$aSnd_id
	Sound ID array as returned by _SoundOpen() or a file name
$iMode
	[optional] This flag determines which format the position of the sound is returned in
	1 = hh:mm:ss where h = hours, m = minutes and s = seconds
	2 = milliseconds
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@

Failure:	0 and set @error
@error:	1 = $iMode is invalid
	3 = Invalid Sound ID. Use return array from _SoundOpen() or a valid file name.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
It is recommended to open a sound file with _SoundOpen() and pass the ID array rather than use the file name in this function.  A VBR encoded file is very unlikely to return the correct position if the file name is passed directly to this function.

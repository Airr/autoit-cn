###Description###
Locks the specified resource in memory.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_LockResource ( $hData )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hData
	Handle to the resource to be locked. The _WinAPI_LoadResource() function returns this handle. Do not
	pass any value as a parameter other than a successful return value from the LoadResource function.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Pointer to the first byte of the resource.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
The pointer returned by this function is valid until the module containing the resource is unloaded. It is not
necessary to unlock resources because the system automatically deletes them when the process that created
them terminates.

Do not try to lock a resource by using the handle returned by the _WinAPI_FindResource() or _WinAPI_FindResourceEx()
function. Such a handle points to random data.

Note _WinAPI_LockResource() does not actually lock memoryit is just used to obtain a pointer to the memory
containing the resource data. The name of the function comes from versions prior to Windows XP, when it was
used to lock a global memory block allocated by _WinAPI_LoadResource().

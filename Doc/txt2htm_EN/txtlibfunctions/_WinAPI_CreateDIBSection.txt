###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_CreateDIBSection

###Description###
Creates a DIB that applications can write to directly.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_CreateDIBSection ( $hDC, ByRef $tBITMAPINFO, $iUsage, ByRef $pBits [, $hSection [, $iOffset]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDC
	Handle to a device context. If the value of $iUsage is $DIB_PAL_COLORS, the function uses this
	device context's logical palette to initialize the DIB colors.
$tBITMAPINFO
	$tagBITMAPINFO structure that specifies various attributes of the DIB, including the bitmap
	dimensions and colors.
$iUsage
	The type of colors used (either logical palette indexes or literal RGB values). The following
	values are defined.
	
	$DIB_PAL_COLORS
	$DIB_RGB_COLORS
	
$pBits
	A pointer to the location of the DIB bit values.
$hSection
	[可选参数] Handle to a file-mapping object that the function will use to create the DIB.
$iOffset
	[可选参数] The offset from the beginning of the file-mapping object referenced by $hSection where storage
	for the bitmap bit values is to begin. This value is ignored if $hSection is 0.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Handle to the newly created DIB, and $pBits points to the bitmap bit values. You can create the
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero, $pBits also is 0.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
When you no longer need the bitmap, call the _WinAPI_DeleteObject() function to delete it.

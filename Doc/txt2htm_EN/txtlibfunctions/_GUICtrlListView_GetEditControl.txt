###Remarks###
When label editing begins, an edit control is created, positioned, and initialized. Before displayed, the
control sends its parent window an $LVN_BEGINLABELEDIT notification message.

If you want to customize label editing implement a handler for $LVN_BEGINLABELEDITA, $LVN_BEGINLABELEDITAW
and have it send an $LVM_GETEDITCONTROL message to the control. If a label is being edited, the return value
will be a handle to the edit control. Use this handle to customize the edit control by sending the usual EM_XXX messages.

When the user completes or cancels editing, the edit control is destroyed and the handle is no longer valid.
You can subclass the edit control, but you should not destroy it. To cancel editing, send the control a
$WM_CANCELMODE message.

The control item being edited is the currently focused item. To find an item based on its state, use the
$LVM_GETNEXTITEM message.

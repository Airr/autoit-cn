###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_BeginPaint

###Description###
Prepares the specified window for painting.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_BeginPaint ( $hWnd, ByRef $tPAINTSTRUCT )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to the window to be repainted.

@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Handle to a display device context for the specified window.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
This function automatically sets the clipping region of the device context to exclude any area outside the
update region. The update region is set by the _WinAPI_InvalidateRect() or _WinAPI_InvalidateRgn() function and
by the system after sizing, moving, creating, scrolling, or any other operation that affects the client area.
If the update region is marked for erasing, _WinAPI_BeginPaint() sends a WM_ERASEBKGND message to the window.

An application should not call _WinAPI_BeginPaint() except in response to a WM_PAINT message. Each call to
_WinAPI_BeginPaint() must have a corresponding call to the _WinAPI_EndPaint() function.

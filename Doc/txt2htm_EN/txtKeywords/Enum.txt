###Remarks###
By default, the first constant will be 0 and the rest will be incremented by 1 from there.
When using the multiply operator to step, the first constant will be assigned 1 and the rest will be multiplied based on the previous constant value.
Constants can be explicitly assigned by any valid statement.

@@ParamTable@@
source
	The source path and filename of the file to move. (* wildcards are supported)
dest
	The destination path and filename of the moved file.  (* wildcards are supported)
flag
	[optional] this flag determines whether to overwrite files if they already exist:
	Can be a combination of the following:
	 0 = (default) do not overwrite existing files
	 1 = overwrite existing files
	 8 = Create destination directory structure if it doesn't exist (See Remarks).
@@End@@


###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns 1.
Failure:	Returns 0 if <i>source</i> cannot be moved or if <i>dest</i> already exists and flag=0.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
If the source and destination paths are on different volumes a copy and delete operation is performed rather than a move.

Because AutoIt lacks a "FileRename" function, use FileMove to rename a file!

The destination directory must already exist, except using with flag value '8'.
For instance the  combined flag '9' (1 + 8) overwrites the target file and prechecks for the destination directory structure and if it doesn't exist creates it automatically.

Some file attributes can make the overwriting impossible.

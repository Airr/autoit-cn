@@ParamTable@@
filename
	filename of the picture to be loaded : supported types BMP, JPG, GIF(but not animated).

	The left side of the control. If -1 is used then left will be computed according to <a href="AutoItSetOption.htm#GUICoordMode">GUICoordMode</a>.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns the identifier (controlID) of the new control.
Failure:	Returns 0 if picture cannot be created.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
To set or change information in the control see <a href="GUICtrlUpdate Management.htm">GUICtrlUpdate...</a>.

To update the picture after the dialog box is displayed just use <a href="GUICtrlSetImage.htm">GUICtrlSetImage</a>

If you want to have a picture having the same size as the file content just use width=height=0.

To have a transparent picture it is needed to create the GUI window with WS_EX_LAYERED extended style. The left-top pixel will be used as the transparency color. If several pictures are created the last picture is defining the transparent color. See example 2.

To combine styles with the default style use <b>BitOr</b>($GUI_SS_DEFAULT_PIC, newstyle,...).

To use the values specified above you must #include <StaticConstants.au3> in your script.

Default resizing is $GUI_DOCKSIZE.

If a picture is set as a background picture, as the other controls will overlap, it's important to disable the pic control and create it after the others controls: GuiCtrlSetState(-1,$GUI_DISABLE). This is not enough for Tab or Listview control which behave differently. In this case you need to create the picture with the $WS_CLIPSIBLINGS style, GuiCtrlSetState(-1,$GUI_ONTOP) is necessary for the Tab, TreeView or Listview control.

The extended style $GUI_WS_EX_PARENTDRAG can be used to allow the dragging of the parent window for windows that don't have a titlebar (no $WS_CAPTION style in GUICreate).

The background is always set to transparent. GUICtrlSetBkColor() has not effect on pic control.

PNG can be used with GDI+. See example 3.

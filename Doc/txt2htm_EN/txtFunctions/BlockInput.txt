A Windows hotfix was released for Windows XP SP1 that contained a bug that prevents the Alt keystroke from being sent (via the Send() function) while BlocKInput() is active.  The Windows bug is fixed in Windows XP SP2 and newer.

BlockInput() only affects user-input.  Input from functions like Send() or MouseMove() still work.

###ReturnValue###
Return the Handle of the splash window that can be used in ControlSetText.


###Remarks###
To skip an optional parameter, leaving it's default value intact, use:
    "" for a string parameters
    -1 for a numeric parameters

Only one SplashImage/Text window is allowed at one time; so if you wish to cycle through multiple images/text, simply call SplashImageOn/SplashTextOn again with the new information.

Even better is to use ControlSetText to update text without flicker...
If the text is center and multiline, the ControlSetText will not override the number of lines created by the SplashTextOn.

Splash with opt=1 cannot be moved and cannot be activated  by click.

Standard font names include:
    Arial, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Lucida Console, Microsoft Sans Serif, System, Tahoma, Times New Roman, and WingDings
See Appendix for a complete font list

Use @LF to display several lines.

###Function###
StringSplit

###Description###
Splits up a string into substrings depending on the given delimiters.

###Syntax###
StringSplit ( "string", "delimiters" [, flag ] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
string
	The string to evaluate.
delimiters
	One or more characters to use as delimiters (case sensitive).
flag
	[optional] Changes how the string split works, add mutliple flag values together if required:
	  flag = 0 (default), each character in the delimiter string will mark where to split the string
	  flag = 1, entire delimiter string is needed to mark the split
	  flag = 2, disable the return the count in the first element - effectively makes the array 0-based (must use UBound() to get the size in this case).
@@End@@


###ReturnValue###
Returns an array, by default the first element ($array[0]) contains the number of strings returned, the remaining elements ($array[1], $array[2], etc.) contain the delimited strings.  If flag = 2 then the count is not return in the first element.

If no delimiters were found @error is set to 1, the count is 1 ($array[0]) and the full string is returned ($array[1]).


###Remarks###
If you use a blank string "" for the delimiters, each character will be returned as an element.

If the delimiter you wish to use is a substring instead of individual single characters, see the example below.

StringSplit is very useful as an alternative to StringInStr and as a means to populate an array.

Caution if you use the macro @CRLF you are referring to a 2 character string so you will generate extra blanks lines.

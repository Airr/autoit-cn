###Remarks###
To skip an optional parameter, leaving it's default value intact, use a value of -1.

The image is scaled to specified width and height and should be a Bitmap, GIF, or JPEG image.  Icons (ICOs) will not display, though the window still appears.  PNG images throw an error message of failing to load, and so do invalid files/paths.

Images are not embedded in the executable unless you use FileInstall

Only one SplashImage/Text window is allowed at one time; so if you wish to cycle through multiple images/text, simply call SplashImageOn/SplashTextOn again with the new information.

Splash with opt=1 cannot be moved and cannot be activated  by click.

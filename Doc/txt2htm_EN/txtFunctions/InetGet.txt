###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	The return value changes depending on if the download is in the background:
	Background: A handle is returned.  The handle can be used with InetGetInfo().  The handle must be closed with InetClose().
	Wait: The number of bytes downloaded.
Failure:	Background: A handle is returned.  To determine if there was an error with the download, use InetGetInfo().  The handle must be closed with InetClose().
	Wait: Sets @error to non-zero and returns 0.

###Remarks###
Internet Explorer 3 or greater must be installed for this function to work.

The URL parameter should be in the form "http://www.somesite.com/path/file.html" - just like an address you would type into your web browser.

To use a username and password when connecting simply prefix the servername with "username:password@", e.g.
"http://myuser:mypassword@www.somesite.com"


<b>Notes about the &quot;background&quot; Parameter</b>

By default the function waits until the download has finished before returning.  If the <b>background</b> parameter is set to 1 the function returns immediately and the download continues in the background.  The function InetGetInfo() can be used to check the status of the download.  It takes the handle returned from InetGet().

Multiple downloads are supported if they are started in background mode.

To abort a download call InetClose() and pass it the handle returned by InetGet().

By default AutoIt forces a connection before starting a download.  For dial-up users this will prompt to go online or dial the modem (depending on how the system is configured).  The options value 16 disables this behavior.  Disabling the behavior can be useful for persistent connects (Broadband, LAN).  However, it is also required to work around certain issues in Windows Vista and Windows 7.

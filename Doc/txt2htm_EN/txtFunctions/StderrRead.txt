###Remarks###
StderrRead reads from the console standard output stream of a child process, which is normally used by console applications to write to the screen. During the call to Run for the child process you wish to read from the STD I/O parameter must have included the value of $STDERR_CHILD (4) for this function to work properly (see the <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> function).
StderrRead does not block, it will return immediately.  In order to get all data, it must be called in a loop.
Peeking on the stream does not remove the data from the buffer, however, it does return the available data as normal.
By default, data is returned in text format.  By using the binary option, the data will be returned in binary format.

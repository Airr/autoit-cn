@@ParamTable@@
filehandle/filename

count
	[optional] The number of characters to read. See remarks.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns the binary/string read. @extended is set to the number of bytes/characters returned.
Special:	Sets @error to -1 if end-of-file is reached.
Failure:	Sets @error to 1 if file not opened in read mode or other error.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
A negative or not defined count, reads the whole file from the current position.

If a filename is given rather than a file handle - the file will be opened and closed during the function call - for parsing large text files this will be much slower than using filehandles.
Note: Do not mix filehandles and filenames, i.e., don't FileOpen a file and then use a filename in this function.  Use either filehandles or filenames in your routines, not both!

Both ANSI and UTF16/UTF8 text formats can be read - AutoIt will automatically determine the type.

A file can be read as binary (byte) data by using FileOpen with the binary flag - in this case count is in bytes rather than characters. A count value that is too large can lead to Autoit stopping with a memory allocation failure.

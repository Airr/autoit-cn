When writing a value that is quoted, the quotes are stripped.  In order to write the quote marks to the value, you must double up the quoting.  For example: ""This is a test"" will produce "This is a test" in the file.
Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped.  In order to preserve the whitespace, the string must be quoted.  For example, "    this is a test" will preserve the whitespace but per above, the quotation marks are stripped.
Multi-line values are not possible.

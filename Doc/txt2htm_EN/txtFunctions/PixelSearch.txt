###Function###
PixelSearch

###Description###
Searches a rectangle of pixels for the pixel color provided.

###Syntax###
PixelSearch ( left, top, right, bottom, color [, shade-variation [, step [, hwnd]]] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
left
	left coordinate of rectangle.
top
	top coordinate of rectangle.
right
	right coordinate of rectangle.
bottom
	bottom coordinate of rectangle.
color
	Colour value of pixel to find (in decimal or hex).
shade-variation
	[optional] A number between 0 and 255 to indicate the allowed number of shades of variation of the red, green, and blue components of the colour. Default is 0 (exact match).
step
	[optional] Instead of searching each pixel use a value larger than 1 to skip pixels (for speed).  E.g. A value of 2 will only check every other pixel.  Default is 1.
hwnd
	[optional] Window handle to be used.
@@End@@


###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns a two-element array of pixel's coordinates. (Array[0] = x, Array[1] = y).
Failure:	Sets @error to 1 if color is not found.
@@End@@


###Remarks###
The search direction varies as follows:
	Left-to-Right - left < right
	Right-to-Left - right < left
	Top-to-Bottom - top < bottom
	Bottom-to-Top - bottom < top
Changing the search direction can be a useful optimization if the color being searched for frequently appears in in a specific quandrat of the search area since less searching is done if the search starts in the most common quadrant.

Remember, a typical display at 1024 x 768 has 786432 pixels. Although PixelSearch is optimized, narrowing the search area helps speed up the result.

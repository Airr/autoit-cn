###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
code
	The required value (integer) to set the @error macro to.
extended
	[optional] The optional value (integer) to set the @extended macro to.  This sets the same macro as the SetExtended() function.
return value
	[optional] Override the default return value and return this parameter.
@@End@@


###ReturnValue###
By default, none, however if the optional return value argument is passed, then the function will return that value.


###Remarks###
When entering a function @error is set to 0.  Unless SetError() is called, then @error will remain 0 after the function has ended.  This means that in order for @error to be set after a function, it must be explicitly set.  This also means you may need to backup the status of @error in a variable if you are testing it in a While-WEnd loop.
The extended parameter is optional.  It is only provided as a way to set both @error and @extended at the same time.  If only @extended needs set, then it is recommended to use the SetExtended() function instead.

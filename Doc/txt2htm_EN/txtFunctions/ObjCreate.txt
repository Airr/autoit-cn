Keep in mind that not all computers have the same set of Objects. So <b>always</b> check for errors after calling ObjCreate(). 

The following requirements apply if you want to access objects on <i>remote</i> computers:
-The user running the script must have the appropriate permissions.
-The Object on the remote computer must support DCOM (Distributed COM)
-The remote computer must have 'Remote Registry Service' and 'File and Printer sharing' services running.

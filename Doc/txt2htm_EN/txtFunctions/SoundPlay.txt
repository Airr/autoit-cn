###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
filename
	Name of the file to be played (typically a WAV or MP3)
wait
	[optional] This flag determines if the script should wait for the sound to finish before continuing:
	1 = wait until sound has finished
	0 = continue script while sound is playing (default)
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
None.  (Always returns 1 regardless of success.)


###Remarks###
Terminating the script will stop the sound (if it is still playing).
Calling SoundPlay("") can be used to stop a currently playing sound.  This has the side effect of also closing the open handle.
If you need to delete a sound file which you have played in the script, you should call SoundPlay("") first to ensure the handle is closed.

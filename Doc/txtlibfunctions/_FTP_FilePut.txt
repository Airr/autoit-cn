		<br/>The transfer type can be one of the following values:
			<b>$FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_ASCII</b> - Transfers the file using FTP's ASCII (Type A) transfer method. Control and formatting information is converted to local equivalents.
			<b>$FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY</b> - Transfers the file using FTP's Image (Type I) transfer method. The file is transferred exactly as it exists with no changes. This is the default transfer method.
			<b>$FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b> - Defaults to $FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY.
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_ASCII</b> - Transfers the file as ASCII.
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_BINARY</b> - Transfers the file as binary.
		<br/>The following values are used to control the caching of the file. The application can use one or more of these values:
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_HYPERLINK</b> - Forces a reload if there was no Expires time and no LastModified time returned from the server when determining whether to reload the item from the network.
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_NEED_FILE</b> - Causes a temporary file to be created if the file cannot be cached.
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD</b> - Forces a download of the requested file, object, or directory listing from the origin server, not from the cache.
			<b>$INTERNET_FLAG_RESYNCHRONIZE</b> - Reloads HTTP resources if the resource has been modified since the last time it was downloaded. All FTP and Gopher resources are reloaded.
$l_Context
	[可选参数] A variable that contains the application-defined value that associates this search with any application data.

###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_CreateEvent

###Description###
Creates or opens a named or unnamed event object

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPI.au3>
_WinAPI_CreateEvent([$pAttributes = 0[, $fManualReset = True[, $fInitialState = True[, $sName = ""]]]])

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$pAttributes
	Pointer to a $tagSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure. If 0, the handle cannot be inherited by child
		processes. The Descriptor member of the structure specifies a security descriptor for the new event. If
		pAttributes is 0, the event gets a default security descriptor. The ACLs in the default security descriptor
		for an event come from the primary or impersonation token of the creator.
$fManualReset
	If True, the function creates a manual-reset event object, which requires the use of the
		ResetEvent function to set the event state to nonsignaled. If False, the function creates an auto-reset event
		object and system automatically resets the event state to nonsignaled after a single waiting thread has been
		released.
$fInitialState
	If True, the initial state of the event object is signaled; otherwise, it is nonsignaled
$sName
	The name of the event object. Name comparison is case sensitive. If sName matches the name of
		an existing named event object, this function requests the EVENT_ALL_ACCESS access right. In this case the
		fManualReset and fInitialState parameters are ignored because they have already been set by the creating
		process. If the pAttributes parameter is not 0, it determines whether the handle can be inherited, but its
		security-descriptor member is ignored. If Name is blank, the event object is created without a name.

###ReturnValue###
Success: The handle to the event object. If the named event object existed before the function call the
		function returns a handle to the existing object and GetLastError returns ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS.
Failure: 0

###Remarks###
None.

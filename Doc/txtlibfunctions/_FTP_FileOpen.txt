The transfer type can be one of the following values.
  $FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_ASCII Transfers the file using FTP's ASCII (Type A) transfer method. Control and formatting information is converted to local equivalents.
  $FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY Transfers the file using FTP's Image (Type I) transfer method. The file is transferred exactly as it exists with no changes. This is the default transfer method.
  $FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_UNKNOWN Defaults to $FTP_TRANSFER_TYPE_BINARY.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_ASCII Transfers the file as ASCII.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_BINARY Transfers the file as binary.

The following values are used to control the caching of the file. The application can use one or more of these values.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_HYPERLINK Forces a reload if there was no Expires time and no LastModified time returned from the server when determining whether to reload the item from the network.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_NEED_FILE Causes a temporary file to be created if the file cannot be cached.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD Forces a download of the requested file, object, or directory listing from the origin server, not from the cache.
  $INTERNET_FLAG_RESYNCHRONIZE Reloads HTTP resources if the resource has been modified since the last time it was downloaded. All FTP and Gopher resources are reloaded.

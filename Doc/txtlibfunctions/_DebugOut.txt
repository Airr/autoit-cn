###User Defined Function###
_DebugOut

###Description###

###Syntax###

_DebugOut ( $sOutput[, $bActivate] )


###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sOutput
	Text string to be output.
$bActivate
	(Optional) Boolean flag, if true make sure the debug window is the active window before writing $sOutput to the debug Notepad window.  Default value is False.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	Returns 1, @Error and @Extended as before calling _DebugOut().
Failure:	Sets @Error and returns 0.
@Error:	0 = No error.
	1 = $sOutput is an incompatible type.
	2 = $bActivate is an incompatible type.
	3 = _DebugSetup() did not run properly.
	4 = The debug Notepad window has been closed.  Output can not occur.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
Each time _DebugOut() is called, the output is put on its own line.

_DebugSetup() must be called before the first call of _DebugOut(), or it will return with @Error = 3.

If the Notepad window is closed, _DebugSetup() will need to be called to restart the debug Notepad session.

Setting $bActivate to True slows down the output of the debug message significantly.

@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to the control
$iButtons
	Number of button images in the bitmap
$hInst
	Handle to the module instance with the executable file that contains a bitmap resource. To use

		$IDB_STD_LARGE_COLOR - Adds large, color standard bitmaps
		$IDB_STD_SMALL_COLOR - Adds small, color standard bitmaps
		$IDB_VIEW_LARGE_COLOR - Adds large, color view bitmaps
		$IDB_VIEW_SMALL_COLOR - Adds small, color view bitmaps
$iID
	If hInst is 0, set this member to the bitmap handle of the bitmap with the button images.
		Otherwise, set it to the resource identifier of the bitmap with the button images. The following are resource
		IDs to the standard and view bitmaps:
		$STD_COPY - Copy image

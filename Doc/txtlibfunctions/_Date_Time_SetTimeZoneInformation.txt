###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$iBias
	The current bias for local time translation on this computer. The bias is the difference in
		minutes between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time. All translations between UTC and local time
		use the following formula: UTC = local time + bias
$sStdName
	The description for standard time
$tStdDate
	A %tagSYSTEMTIME structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from
		daylight saving time to standard time occurs.
$iStdBias
	The bias value to be used during local time translations that occur during standard time. This
		value is added to the value of the Bias to form the bias used during standard time. In most time zones, this
		value is zero.
$sDayName
	The description for daylight saving time
$tDayDate
	A %tagSYSTEMTIME structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from
		standard time to daylight saving time occurs.
$iDayBias
	The bias value to be used during local time translation that occur during daylight saving time.
		This value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during daylight saving time. In
		most time zones this value is -60.

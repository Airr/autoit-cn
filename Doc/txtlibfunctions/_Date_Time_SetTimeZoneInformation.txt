_Date_Time_SetTimeZoneInformation($iBias, $sStdName, $tStdDate, $iStdBias, $sDayName, $tDayDate, $iDayBias)

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$iBias
	The current bias for local time translation on this computer. The bias is the difference in minutes between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time. All translations between UTC and local time use the following formula: UTC = local time + bias
$sStdName
	The description for standard time
$tStdDate
	A $tagSYSTEMTIME structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from daylight saving time to standard time occurs.
$iStdBias
	The bias value to be used during local time translations that occur during standard time. This value is added to the value of the Bias to form the bias used during standard time. In most time zones, this value is zero.
$sDayName
	The description for daylight saving time
$tDayDate
	A $tagSYSTEMTIME structure that contains a date and local time when the transition from standard time to daylight saving time occurs.
$iDayBias
	The bias value to be used during local time translation that occur during daylight saving time. This value is added to the value of the Bias member to form the bias used during daylight saving time. In most time zones this value is –60.

###Remarks###
To select the correct day in the month, set the wYear member to zero, the wHour and wMinute members to the transition time, the wDayOfWeek member to the appropriate weekday, and the wDay member to indicate the occurrence of the day of the week within the month (1 to 5, where 5 indicates the final occurrence during the month if that day of the week does not occur 5 times).

Using this notation, specify 02:00 on the first Sunday in April as follows: wHour = 2, wMonth = 4, wDayOfWeek = 0, wDay = 1. Specify 02:00 on the last Thursday in October as follows: wHour = 2, wMonth = 10, wDayOfWeek = 4, wDay = 5.

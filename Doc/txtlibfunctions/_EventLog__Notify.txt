###User Defined Function###
_EventLog__Notify

###Description###
Enables an application to receive event notifications

###Syntax###
#Include <EventLog.au3>
_EventLog__Notify($hEventLog, $hEvent)

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hEventLog
	A handle to the event log
$hEvent
	A handle to a manual-reset event object
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
Success: True
Failure: False

###Remarks###
This function does not work with remote handles. If the hEventLog parameter is the handle to an event log on a
remote computer, this function returns zero, and GetLastError returns ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE. When an event is
written to the log specified by hEventLog, the system uses the PulseEvent function to set the event specified
by the hEvent parameter to the signaled state. If the thread is not waiting on the event when the system calls
PulseEvent, the thread will not receive the notification. Therefore, you should create a separate thread to
wait for notifications. Note that the system calls PulseEvent no more than once every five seconds. Therefore,
even if more than one event log change occurs within a five second interval, you will only receive one
notification. The system will continue to notify you of changes until you close the handle to the event log.
To close the event log, use the _EventLog__Close or _EventLog__DeregisterSource function.

@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to a Window
$tRect
	<b>Optional:</b> $tagRECT structure containing the coordinates of the update rectangle. This parameter is
		ignored if the $hRegion parameter identifies a region.
$hRegion
	<b>Optional:</b> Identifies the update region. If the $hRegion and $tRect parameters are 0, the entire client
		area is added to the update region.
$iFlags
	<b>Optional:</b> Specifies the redraw flags. This parameter can be a combination of flags that invalidate or
		validate a window, control repainting, and control which windows are affected:
		$RDW_ERASE - Causes the window to receive a WM_ERASEBKGND message when the window is repainted
		$RDW_FRAME - Causes any part of the nonclient area of the window that intersects the update region
		to receive a WM_NCPAINT message.
		$RDW_INTERNALPAINT - Causes a WM_PAINT message to be posted to the window regardless of whether any portion
		of the window is invalid.
		$RDW_INVALIDATE - Invalidates DllStructGetData($tRect or $hRegion, "") If both are 0, the entire window is invalidated.
		$RDW_NOERASE - Suppresses any pending $WM_ERASEBKGND messages
		$RDW_NOFRAME - Suppresses any pending $WM_NCPAINT messages
		$RDW_NOINTERNALPAINT - Suppresses any pending internal $WM_PAINT messages
		$RDW_VALIDATE - Validates $tRect or $hRegion
		$RDW_ERASENOW - Causes the affected windows to receive $WM_NCPAINT and $WM_ERASEBKGND messages, if
		necessary, before the function returns
		$RDW_UPDATENOW - Causes the affected windows to receive $WM_NCPAINT, $WM_ERASEBKGND, and $WM_PAINT
		messages, if necessary, before the function returns.
		$RDW_ALLCHILDREN - Includes child windows in the repainting operation
		$RDW_NOCHILDREN - Excludes child windows from the repainting operation

###Remarks###
When RedrawWindow is used to invalidate part of the desktop window, the desktop window does not receive a
$WM_PAINT message. To repaint the desktop an application uses the $RDW_ERASE flag to generate a $WM_ERASEBKGND
message.

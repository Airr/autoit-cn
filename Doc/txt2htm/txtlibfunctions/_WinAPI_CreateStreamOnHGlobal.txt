###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_CreateStreamOnHGlobal

###Description###
Creates a stream object that uses a memory handle to store the stream contents.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_CreateStreamOnHGlobal ( $hGlobal [, $fDeleteOnRelease] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hGlobal
	The memory handle, or if 0 a new handle is to be allocated instead. The handle must be
	allocated as moveable and nondiscardable.
$fDeleteOnRelease
	[可选参数] Specifies whether the underlying handle for this stream object should be automatically
	freed when the stream object is released, valid values:
		TRUE             - The final release will automatically free the $hGlobal parameter. (Default)
		FALSE            - The user must free the $hGlobal after the final release.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The pointer to the new stream object.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended flag may contain the system error code.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
If $hGlobal is 0, the function allocates a new memory handle and the stream is initially empty, otherwise, the
initial contents of the stream are the current contents of the memory block. Thus, _WinAPI_CreateStreamOnHGlobal()
can be used to open an existing stream in memory. The memory handle and its contents are undisturbed by the
creation of the new stream object.

After creating the stream object with _WinAPI_CreateStreamOnHGlobal(), call _WinAPI_GetHGlobalFromStream() to
retrieve the memory handle associated with the stream object.

Success	The array that contains the following information:
]	If TRUE, there is a system power button.
]	If TRUE, there is a system sleep button.
]	If TRUE, there is a lid switch.
]	If TRUE, the operating system supports sleep state S1.
]	If TRUE, the operating system supports sleep state S2.
]	If TRUE, the operating system supports sleep state S3.
]	If TRUE, the operating system supports sleep state S4 (hibernation).
]	If TRUE, the operating system supports power off state S5 (soft off).
]	If TRUE, the system hibernation file is present.
]	If TRUE, the system supports wake capabilities.
[10]	If TRUE, the system supports video display dimming capabilities.
[11]	If TRUE, the system supports APM BIOS power management features.
[12]	If TRUE, there is an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).
[13]	If TRUE, the system supports thermal zones.
[14]	If TRUE, the system supports processor throttling.
[15]	The minimum level of system processor throttling supported, expressed as a percentage.
[16]	The maximum level of system processor throttling supported, expressed as a percentage.
[17]	If TRUE, the system supports the hybrid sleep state.
[18]	If TRUE, the system supports allowing the removal of power to fixed disk devices.
[19]	If TRUE, there are one or more batteries in the system.
[20]	If TRUE, the system batteries are short-term. Short-term batteries are used in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).
[21]	The lowest system sleep state (Sx) that will generate a wake event when the system is on AC power.
[22]	The lowest system sleep state (Sx) that will generate a wake event via the lid switch.
[23]	The lowest system sleep state (Sx) supported by hardware that will generate a wake event via the RTC.
[24]	The minimum allowable system power state supporting wake events.
失败:	返回 0 并设置 @error 标志为非 0 值.

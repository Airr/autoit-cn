$sPathFrom
	The path to the file or directory that defines the start of the relative path.
$fDirFrom

		TRUE      - Directory.
		FALSE     - File.
$sPathTo
	The path to the file or directory that defines the endpoint of the relative path.

###Remarks###
This function takes a pair of paths and generates a relative path from one to the other. The paths do not have
to be fully-qualified, but they must have a common prefix, otherwise, the function fails.

For example, let the starting point, $sPathFrom, be "C:\A\B\C", and the ending point, $sPathTo, be "C:\A\D".
_WinAPI_PathRelativePathTo() will return the relative path from $sPathFrom to $sPathTo as: "..\..\D\E". You will
get the same result if you set $sPathFrom to "\A\B\C" and $sPathTo to "\A\D\E". On the other hand, "C:\A\B\C"
and "D:\A\D" do not share a common prefix, and the function will fail. Note that "\" is not considered a prefix
and is ignored. If you set $sPathFrom to "\\A\B\C", and $sPathTo to "\\C\D", the function will fail.

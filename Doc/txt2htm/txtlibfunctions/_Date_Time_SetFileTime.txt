###Description###
设置文件创建,访问,修改日期与时间

###Syntax###

_Date_Time_SetFileTime($hFile, $pCreateTime, $pLastAccess, $pLastWrite)

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hFile
	Handle to the file. The file handle must have been created using the CreateFile function with
		the FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES access right.
$pCreateTime
	Pointer to a $tagFILETIME structure that contains the new date and time the file was created.
		This be 0 if the application does not need to set this information.
$pLastAccess
	Pointer to a $tagFILETIME structure that contains the new date and time the file was last
		accessed. The last access time includes the last time the file was written to, read from, or (in the case of
		executable files) run. This can be 0 if the application does not need to set this information. To preserve
		the existing last access time for a file even after accessing a file, call SetFileTime with this parameter
		set to -1 before closing the file handle.
$pLastWrite
	Pointer to a $tagFILETIME structure that contains the new date and time the file was last
		written to. This can be 0 if the application does not want to set this information.

成功:	True

###Remarks###
Not all file systems can record creation and last access times and not all file systems record them in the
same manner. For example, on FAT, create time has a resolution of 10 milliseconds, write time has a resolution
of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of 1 day (really, the access date). Therefore, the GetFileTime
function may not return the same file time information set using SetFileTime. NTFS delays updates to the last
access time for a file by up to one hour after the last access.

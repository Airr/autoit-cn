###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$tStruct
	A structure that was created by DllStructCreate(), or memory address to be display its data.
$sStruct
	[可选参数] A string representing the structure. If $tStruct is a structure, this parameter can be omitted or be
	an empty string. In this case, the structure will display as "byte[n]" structure. If $tStruct is a
	memory address, $sStruct should be a string representing the structure, otherwise, the function
	fail, and @error set to 1.
$sTitle
	[可选参数] The title of the window, deault is "Structure: ListView Display".

$iFlags

###Function###
_WinAPI_PolyBezierTo

###Description###
Draws one or more Bezier curves.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_PolyBezierTo ( $hDC, $aPoint [, $iStart [, $iEnd]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDC
	Handle to a device context.
$aPoint
	The 2D array ([x1, y1], [x2, y2], ... [xN, yN]) that contains the endpoints and control points of the
	curve(s), in logical units. The number of points must be three times the number of curves to be drawn,
	because each Bezier curve requires two control points and an ending point.
$iStart
	The index of array to start drawing at.
$iEnd
	The index of array to stop drawing at.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
This function draws cubic Bezier curves by using the control points specified by the $aPoint parameter.
The first curve is drawn from the current position to the third point by using the first two points as control points.
For each subsequent curve, the function needs exactly three more points, and uses the ending point of the previous
curve as the starting point for the next.

The current position moves to the ending point of the last Bezier curve. The figure is not filled.

This function draws lines by using the current pen.

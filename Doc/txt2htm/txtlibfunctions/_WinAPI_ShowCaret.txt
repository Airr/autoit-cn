###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_ShowCaret

###Description###

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_ShowCaret ( $hWnd )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to the window that owns the caret. If this parameter is 0, _WinAPI_ShowCaret() searches the
	current task for the window that owns the caret.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
_WinAPI_ShowCaret() shows the caret only if the specified window owns the caret, the caret has a shape,
and the caret has not been hidden two or more times in a row. If one or more of these conditions is not met,
_WinAPI_ShowCaret() does nothing and returns 0.

Hiding is cumulative. If your application calls _WinAPI_HideCaret() five times in a row, it must also call
_WinAPI_ShowCaret() five times before the caret reappears.

###Function###
_WinAPI_CreateEnhMetaFile

###Description###
Creates a device context for an enhanced-format metafile.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_CreateEnhMetaFile ( [$hDC [, $tRECT [, $fPixels [, $sFile [, $sDescription]]]]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDC
	Handle to a reference device for the enhanced metafile. The system uses this device context to
	record the resolution and units of the device on which a picture originally appeared.
	If this parameter is 0, it uses the current display device for reference.
$tRECT
	$tagRECT structure that specifies the dimensions of the picture to be stored in the enhanced metafile.
	If this parameter is 0, the graphics device interface computes
	the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that surrounds the picture drawn by the application.
$fPixels
	Specifies whether the $tRECT structure defined in pixels, valid values:
		TRUE         - In logical units (pixels).
		FALSE        - In .01-millimeter units. (Default)
$sFile
	The file name for the enhanced metafile to be created. If this parameter is 0, the enhanced
	metafile is memory based and its contents are lost when it is deleted by using the
	_WinAPI_DeleteEnhMetaFile() function.
$sDescription
	The string that specifies the name of the application that created the picture, as well as the
	picture's title. This string must be an empty string or represented as follows:
	
	"application name|picture name"

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Handle to the device context for the enhanced metafile.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.

###Remarks###
Applications use the device context created by this function to store a graphics picture in an enhanced metafile.
The handle identifying this device context can be passed to any GDI function.

After an application stores a picture in an enhanced metafile, it can display the picture on any output device by
calling the _WinAPI_PlayEnhMetaFile() function. When displaying the picture, the system uses the rectangle pointed
to by the $tRECT parameter and the resolution data from the reference device to position and scale the picture.

The file name for the enhanced metafile should use the .emf extension.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
After you associate a process with a job object, the process is subject to the limits set for the job. To set
limits for a job, use the _WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject() function.

The process can be associated only with a single job. The process inherits limits from the job it is associated
with and adds its accounting information to the job. If a process is associated with a job, all processes it
creates are associated with that job by default.

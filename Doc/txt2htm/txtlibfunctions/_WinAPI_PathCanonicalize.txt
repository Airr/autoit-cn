###ReturnValue###

###Remarks###
This function allows the user to specify what to remove from a path by inserting special character sequences
into the path. The ".." sequence indicates to remove a path segment from the current position to the previous path
segment. The "." sequence indicates to skip over the next path segment to the following path segment. The root
segment of the path cannot be removed.

If there are more ".." sequences than there are path segments, the function returns just the root, "\".

$sName
	[可选参数] The name of the job. Name comparison is case-sensitive. If this parameter is 0, the job is
	created without a name.
$tSecurity
	[可选参数] $tagSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that specifies the security descriptor for the job object
	and determines whether child processes can inherit the returned handle. If this parameter is 0,

Success	Handle to the job object. If the object existed before the function call, the function
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.

###Remarks###
When a job is created, its accounting information is initialized to zero, all limits are inactive, and there
are no associated processes. To assign a process to a job object, use the _WinAPI_AssignProcessToJobObject()
function. To set limits for a job, use the _WinAPI_SetInformationJobObject() function. To query accounting
information, use the _WinAPI_QueryInformationJobObject() function.

All processes associated with a job must run in the same session. A job is associated with the session of the
first process to be assigned to the job.

To close a job object handle, use the _WinAPI_CloseHandle() function. The job is destroyed when its last
handle has been closed and all associated processes have exited.

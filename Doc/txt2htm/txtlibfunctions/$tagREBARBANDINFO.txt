###Fields###
@@ParamTable@@
cbSize
	数据结构(structure)大小, 使用字节表示. Your application must fill this member before sending any messages that use the address of this structure as a parameter.
fMask
	Flags that indicate which members of this structure are valid or must be filled. This value can be a combination of the following:;
		$RBBIM_BACKGROUND - The hbmBack member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_CHILD - The hwndChild member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_CHILDSIZE - The cxMinChild, cyMinChild, cyChild, cyMaxChild, and cyIntegral members are valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_COLORS - The clrFore and clrBack members are valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_HEADERSIZE - Version 4.71. The cxHeader member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_IDEALSIZE - Version 4.71. The cxIdeal member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_ID - The wID member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_IMAGE - The iImage member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_LPARAM - Version 4.71. The lParam member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_SIZE - The cx member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_STYLE - The fStyle member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_TEXT - The lpText member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_CHEVRONLOCATION - The rcChevronLocation member is valid or must be set.
		$RBBIM_CHEVRONSTATE - The uChevronState member is valid or must be set.
fStyle
	Flags that specify the band style. This value can be a combination of the following:
		$RBBS_BREAK - The band is on a new line.
		$RBBS_CHILDEDGE - The band has an edge at the top and bottom of the child window.
		$RBBS_FIXEDBMP - The background bitmap does not move when the band is resized.
		$RBBS_FIXEDSIZE - The band can't be sized. With this style, the sizing grip is not displayed on the band.
		$RBBS_GRIPPERALWAYS - Version 4.71. The band will always have a sizing grip, even if it is the only band in the rebar.
		$RBBS_HIDDEN - The band will not be visible.
		$RBBS_NOGRIPPER - Version 4.71. The band will never have a sizing grip, even if there is more than one band in the rebar.
		$RBBS_USECHEVRON - Version 5.80. Show a chevron button if the band is smaller than cxIdeal.
		$RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT - Version 4.71. The band can be resized by the rebar control; cyIntegral and cyMaxChild affect how the rebar will resize the band.
		$RBBS_NOVERT - Don't show when vertical.
		$RBBS_USECHEVRON - Display drop-down button.
		$RBBS_HIDETITLE - Keep band title hidden.
		$RBBS_TOPALIGN - Keep band in top row.
clrFore
	Band foreground colors.
clrBack
	Band background colors.
		If hbmBack specifies a background bitmap, these members are ignored.
		By default, the band will use the background color of the rebar control set with the $RB_SETBKCOLOR message.
		If a background color is specified here, then this background color will be used instead.
lpText
	Pointer to a buffer that contains the display text for the band.
		If band information is being requested from the control and $RBBIM_TEXT is specified in fMask,
		this member must be initialized to the address of the buffer that will receive the text.
cch
	Size of the buffer at lpText, in bytes. If information is not being requested from the control, this member is ignored.
iImage
	Zero-based index of any image that should be displayed in the band. The image list is set using the $RB_SETBARINFO message.
hwndChild
	Handle to the child window contained in the band, if any.
cxMinChild
	Minimum width of the child window, in pixels. The band can't be sized smaller than this value.
cyMinChild
	Minimum height of the child window, in pixels. The band can't be sized smaller than this value.
cx
	Length of the band, in pixels.
hbmBack
	Handle to a bitmap that is used as the background for this band.
wID
	UINT value that the control uses to identify this band for custom draw notification messages.
cyChild
	Version 4.71. Initial height of the band, in pixels. This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.
cyMaxChild
	Version 4.71. Maximum height of the band, in pixels. This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.
cyIntegral
	Version 4.71. Step value by which the band can grow or shrink, in pixels.
		If the band is resized, it will be resized in steps specified by this value.
		This member is ignored unless the $RBBS_VARIABLEHEIGHT style is specified.
cxIdeal
	Version 4.71. Ideal width of the band, in pixels.
		If the band is maximized to the ideal width (see $RB_MAXIMIZEBAND), the rebar control will attempt to make the band this width.
lParam
	Version 4.71. Application-defined value.
cxHeader
	Version 4.71. Size of the band's header, in pixels.
		The band header is the area between the edge of the band and the edge of the child window.
		This is the area where band text and images are displayed, if they are specified.
		If this value is specified, it will override the normal header dimensions that the control calculates for the band.

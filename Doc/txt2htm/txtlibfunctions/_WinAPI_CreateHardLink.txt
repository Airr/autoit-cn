###Remarks###
The _WinAPI_CreateHardLink() is only supported on the NTFS file system, and only for files, not directories.

The security descriptor belongs to the file to which a hard link points. The link itself is only a directory entry,
and does not have a security descriptor. Therefore, when you change the security descriptor of a hard link, you
a change the security descriptor of the underlying file, and all hard links that point to the file allow the newly
specified access. You cannot give a file different security descriptors on a per-hard-link basis.

Use _WinAPI_DeleteFile() function to delete hard links. You can delete them in any order regardless of the
order in which they are created.

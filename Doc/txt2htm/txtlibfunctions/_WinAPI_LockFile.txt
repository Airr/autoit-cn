###Remarks###
If a process terminates with a portion of a file locked or closes a file that has outstanding locks, the locks are
unlocked by the operating system. However, the time it takes for the operating system to unlock these locks depends
upon available system resources. Therefore, it is recommended that your process explicitly unlock all files it
has locked when it terminates.

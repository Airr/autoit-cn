###Remarks###
Calling this function causes the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) to invalidate its current bitmaps for the window
and request new bitmaps from the window when they are next needed. _WinAPI_DwmInvalidateIconicBitmaps() should
not be called frequently. Doing so can lead to poor performance as new bitmaps are created and retrieved.

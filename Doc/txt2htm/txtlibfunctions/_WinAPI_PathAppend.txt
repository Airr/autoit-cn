###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_PathAppend

###Description###
Appends one path to the end of another.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_PathAppend ( $sPath, $sMore )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sPath
	The string to which the path is appended.
$sMore
	The path to be appended.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The resulting path string.
Failure	Empty string and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
This function automatically inserts a backslash between the two strings, if one is not already present.

The first path cannot begin with "..\\" or ".\\" to produce a relative path string. If present, those periods are
stripped from the output string. For example, appending "path3" to "..\\path1\\path2" results in an output
of "\path1\path2\path3" rather than "..\path1\path2\path3".

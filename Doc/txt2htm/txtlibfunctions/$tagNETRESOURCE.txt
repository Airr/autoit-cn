@@ParamTable@@
Scope
	Scope of the enumeration:
		$RESOURCE_CONNECTED - Enumerate currently connected resources
		$RESOURCE_GLOBALNET - Enumerate all resources on the network
		$RESOURCE_REMEMBERED - Enumerate remembered connections
Type
	Set of bit flags identifying the type of resource:
		$RESOURCETYPE_ANY - All resources
		$RESOURCETYPE_DISK - Disk resources
		$RESOURCETYPE_PRINT - Print resources
DisplayType
	Display options for the network object in a network browsing user interface:
		$RESOURCEDISPLAYTYPE_DOMAIN - The object should be displayed as a domain
		$RESOURCEDISPLAYTYPE_SERVER - The object should be displayed as a server
		$RESOURCEDISPLAYTYPE_SHARE - The object should be displayed as a share
		$RESOURCEDISPLAYTYPE_GENERIC - The method used to display the object does not matter
Usage
	Set of bit flags describing how the resource can be used. Note that this member can be specified
	only if the Scope member is equal to $RESOURCE_GLOBALNET. This member can be one of the following values:
		$RESOURCEUSAGE_CONNECTABLE - The resource is a connectable resource; the name pointed to by RemoteName can be
	passed to the _WNet_AddConnection function to make a network connection.
		$RESOURCEUSAGE_CONTAINER - The resource is a container resource; the name pointed to by RemoteName can be
	passed to the WNet_OpenEnum function to enumerate the resources in the container.
LocalName
	If the Scope member is equal to $RESOURCE_CONNECTED or $RESOURCE_REMEMBERED, this member is a
	pointer to a null terminated character string that specifies the name of a local device. This member is 0 if
	the connection does not use a device.
RemoteName
	If the entry is a network resource, this member is a pointer to a null terminated string that
	specifies the remote network name. If the entry is a current or persistent connection, RemoteName points to
	the network name associated with the name pointed to by the LocalName member.
Comment
	Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains a comment supplied by the network provider
Provider
	Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the name of the provider that owns the
	resource. This member can be NULL if the provider name is unknown. To retrieve the provider name, you can
	call the _WNet_GetProviderName function.

###Function###
_WinAPI_SetWindowTheme

###Description###
Causes a window to use a different set of visual style information than its class normally uses.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_SetWindowTheme ( $hWnd [, $sName [, $sList]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hWnd
	Handle to the window whose visual style information is to be changed.
$sName
	A string that contains the application name. If this parameter is 0, the calling application's name is used.
$sList
	A string that contains a semicolon-separated list of CLSID names to use in place of the actual list
	passed by the window's class. If this parameter is 0, the ID list from the calling class is used.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended flag may contain the system error code.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
The theme manager retains the $sName and the $sList associations through the lifetime of the window, even
if visual styles subsequently change.

When $sName and $sList are 0, the theme manager removes the previously applied associations. To prevent visual
styles from being applied to a specified window, pass an empty string ("") which will not match any section
entries.

###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_PlgBlt

###Description###
Performs a bit-block transfer of color data from the specified rectangle in the source DC to the specified parallelogram in the DC context.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_PlgBlt ( $hDestDC, Const ByRef $aPoint, $hSrcDC, $iXSrc, $iYSrc, $iWidth, $iHeight [, $hMask [, $iXMask [, $iYMask]]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hDestDC
	Handle to the destination device context.
$aPoint
	The 2D array ([x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3]) that identify three corners of the destination parallelogram.
	The upper-left corner of the source rectangle is mapped to the first point in this array, the upper-right
	corner to the second point in this array, and the lower-left corner to the third point. The lower-right
	corner of the source rectangle is mapped to the implicit fourth point in the parallelogram.
$hSrcDC
	Handle to the source device context.
$iXSrc
	The x-coordinate, in logical units, of the upper-left corner of the source rectangle.
$iYSrc
	The y-coordinate, in logical units, of the upper-left corner of the source rectangle.
$iWidth
	The width, in logical units, of the source rectangle.
$iHeight
	The height, in logical units, of the source rectangle.
$hMask
	[可选参数] Handle to the monochrome bitmap that is used to mask the colors of the source rectangle.
$iXMask
	[可选参数] The x-coordinate, in logical units, of the upper-left corner of the monochrome bitmap.
$iYMask
	[可选参数] The y-coordinate, in logical units, of the upper-left corner of the monochrome bitmap.

Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.

###Remarks###
The _WinAPI_PlgBlt() works with device-dependent bitmaps. If the source and destination device contexts represent
incompatible devices, the function returns an error.

The fourth vertex of the parallelogram (D) is defined by treating the first three points (A, B, and C) as vectors
and computing D = B + CA.

If the bitmask is specified, a value of 1 in the mask indicates that the source pixel color should be copied to the
destination. A value of 0 in the mask indicates that the destination pixel color is not to be changed. If the mask
rectangle is smaller than the source and destination rectangles, the function replicates the mask pattern.

Scaling, translation, and reflection transformations are allowed in the source device contexthowever, rotation
and shear transformations are not. If the mask bitmap is not a monochrome bitmap, an error occurs. The stretching
mode for the destination device context is used to determine how to stretch or compress the pixels, if that is
necessary.

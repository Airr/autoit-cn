@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Handle to the icon or cursor that is created.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
The system copies the bitmaps before creating the icon or cursor. Because the system may temporarily
select the bitmaps in a device context, $hBitmap and $hMask should not already be selected into a device context.
The application must continue to manage the original bitmaps and delete them by _WinAPI_DeleteObject() when they
are no longer necessary.

###Function###
_WinAPI_CoTaskMemRealloc

###Description###
Changes the size of a previously allocated block of task memory.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_CoTaskMemRealloc ( $hMemory, $iSize )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hMemory
	The pointer to the memory block to be reallocated.
$iSize
	The size of the memory block to be reallocated, in bytes.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The reallocated memory block.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
If $hMemory is 0, function allocates a new memory block in the same way as the _WinAPI_CoTaskMemAlloc() function.
If $hMemory is not 0, it should be a pointer returned by a prior call to _WinAPI_CoTaskMemAlloc().

The contents of the block are unchanged up to the shorter of the new and old sizes, although the new block
can be in a different location. If $hMemory is not 0 and $iSize is 0, then the memory pointed to by
$hMemory is freed.

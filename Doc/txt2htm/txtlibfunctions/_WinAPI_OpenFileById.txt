###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hFile
	The path or handle to any file on a volume or share on which the file to be opened is stored.
$tGUID
	$tagGUID structure or its string representation that identifies the file to open.
$iAccess
	The access to the object. Access can be read, write, or both. If this parameter is 0, the application
	can query file and device attributes without accessing a device.
	
	$GENERIC_READ
	$GENERIC_WRITE
	
	(See MSDN for more information)
	
$iShare
	The sharing mode of an object, which can be read, write, both, or none. If this parameter is 0 and
	function succeeds, the object cannot be shared and cannot be opened again until the handle
	is closed.
	
	$FILE_SHARE_DELETE
	$FILE_SHARE_READ
	$FILE_SHARE_WRITE
	
$iFlags
	[可选参数] The file flags. When _WinAPI_OpenFileById() opens a file, it combines the file flags with existing
	file attributes, and ignores any supplied file attributes. This parameter can include any
	combination of the following values.
	
	$FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS
	$FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING
	$FILE_FLAG_OPEN_NO_RECALL
	$FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT
	$FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED
	$FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS
	$FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN
	$FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH

###ReturnValue###

Success	Handle to a specified file.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
When an application is finished using the object handle returned by this function, use the _WinAPI_CloseHandle()
function to close the handle. This not only frees up system resources, but can have wider influence on things
like sharing the file or device and committing data to disk.

This function requires Windows Vista or later.

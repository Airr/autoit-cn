@@ParamTable@@
$sFile
	The name of the file or device to be created or opened.
$iCreation
	The action to take on a file or device that exists or does not exist. This parameter must be
	one of the following values, which cannot be combined.
	
	$CREATE_NEW
	$CREATE_ALWAYS
	$OPEN_EXISTING
	$OPEN_ALWAYS
	$TRUNCATE_EXISTING
	
$iAccess
	The requested access to the file or device, which can be summarized as read, write, both
	or neither (zero).
	
	$GENERIC_READ
	$GENERIC_WRITE
	
	(See MSDN for more information)
	
$iShare
	The requested sharing mode of the file or device, which can be read, write, both,
	delete, all of these, or none. If this parameter is 0 and _WinAPI_CreateFileEx() succeeds,
	the file or device cannot be shared and cannot be opened again until the handle to
	the file or device is closed.
	
	$FILE_SHARE_READ
	$FILE_SHARE_WRITE
	$FILE_SHARE_DELETE
	
$iFlagsAndAttributes
	[可选参数] The file or device attributes and flags. This parameter can be one or more of the
	following values.
	
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_CONTENT_INDEXED
	$FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTED
	
	$FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS
	$FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE
	$FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING
	$FILE_FLAG_OPEN_NO_RECALL
	$FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT
	$FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED

	$FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN
	$FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH
	
	$SECURITY_ANONYMOUS
	$SECURITY_CONTEXT_TRACKING
	$SECURITY_DELEGATION
	$SECURITY_EFFECTIVE_ONLY
	$SECURITY_IDENTIFICATION
	$SECURITY_IMPERSONATION
	
$tSecurity
	[可选参数] $tagSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that contains two separate but related data members:
	an optional security descriptor, and a Boolean value that determines whether the returned
	handle can be inherited by child processes. If this parameter is 0, the handle cannot
	be inherited by any child processes the application may create and the file or device
	associated with the returned handle gets a default security descriptor.
$hTemplate
	[可选参数] Handle to a template file with the $GENERIC_READ access right. The template file supplies
	file attributes and extended attributes for the file that is being created.

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	Handle to the specified file, device, named pipe, or mail slot.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
When an application is finished using the object handle returned by this function, use the _WinAPI_CloseHandle()
function to close the handle. This not only frees up system resources, but can have wider influence on things
like sharing the file or device and committing data to disk.

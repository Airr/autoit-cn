###Function###
_WinAPI_UnmapViewOfFile

###Description###
Unmaps a mapped view of a file from the calling process's address space.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_UnmapViewOfFile ( $pAddress )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$pAddress
	A pointer to the base address of the mapped view of a file that is to be unmapped. This value must be
	identical to the value returned by a previous call to the _WinAPI_MapViewOfFile() function.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	1.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
Unmapping a mapped view of a file invalidates the range occupied by the view in the address space of the process
and makes the range available for other allocations. It removes the working set entry for each unmapped virtual page
that was part of the working set of the process and reduces the working set size of the process. It also
decrements the share count of the corresponding physical page.

Although an application may close the file handle used to create a file mapping object, the system holds the
corresponding file open until the last view of the file is unmapped. Files for which the last view has not
yet been unmapped are held open with no sharing restrictions.

To minimize the risk of data loss in the event of a power failure or a system crash, you should explicitly flush
modified pages using the _WinAPI_FlushViewOfFile() function.

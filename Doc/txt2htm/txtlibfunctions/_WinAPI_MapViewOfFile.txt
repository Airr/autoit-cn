###Description###
Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of a calling process.

_WinAPI_MapViewOfFile ( $hMapping [, $iOffset [, $iBytes [, $iAccess]]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hMapping
	Handle to a file mapping object. The _WinAPI_CreateFileMapping() and _WinAPI_OpenFileMapping()
	functions return this handle.
$iOffset
	The file offset where the view is to begin.
$iBytes
	The number of bytes of a file mapping to map to a view. All bytes must be within the maximum size
	specified by _WinAPI_CreateFileMapping(). If $iBytes is 0, the mapping extends from the specified
	offset to the end of the file mapping.
$iAccess
	The access to the file mapping object. This parameter can be one of the following values.
	
	$FILE_MAP_ALL_ACCESS
	$FILE_MAP_COPY

###Remarks###
For files that are larger than the address space, you can only map a small portion of the file data at one time.
When the first view is complete, then you unmap it and map a new view.

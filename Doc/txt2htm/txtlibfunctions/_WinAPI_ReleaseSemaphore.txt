###Function###
_WinAPI_ReleaseSemaphore

###Description###
Increases the count of the specified semaphore object by a specified amount.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_ReleaseSemaphore ( $hSemaphore [, $iIncrease] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$hSemaphore
	Handle to the semaphore object. The _WinAPI_CreateSemaphore() or _WinAPI_OpenSemaphore() function
	returns this handle.
$iIncrease
	The amount by which the semaphore object's current count is to be increased. The value must be greater
	than zero. If the specified amount would cause the semaphore's count to exceed the maximum count that
	was specified when the semaphore was created, the count is not changed and the function returns 0.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The previous count for the semaphore.
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
The state of a semaphore object is signaled when its count is greater than zero and nonsignaled when its count
is equal to zero. The process that calls the _WinAPI_CreateSemaphore() function specifies the semaphore's initial
count. Each time a waiting process is released because of the semaphore's signaled state, the count of the
semaphore is decreased by one.

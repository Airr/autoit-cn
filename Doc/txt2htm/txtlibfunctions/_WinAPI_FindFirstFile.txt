###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_FindFirstFile

###Description###
Searches a directory for a file or subdirectory with a name that matches a specific name.

###Syntax###
#Include <WinAPIEx.au3>
_WinAPI_FindFirstFile ( $sPath, $pData )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$sPath
	The directory or path, and the file name, which can include wildcard characters, for example, an asterisk
	"*" or a question mark "?". If the string ends with a wildcard, period ".", or directory name, the user
	must have access permissions to the root and all subdirectories on the path.
$pData
	A pointer to the $tagWIN32_FIND_DATA structure that receives information about a found file or directory.
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success	The search handle, and the $tagWIN32_FIND_DATA structure contains information about the first file
Failure	0 and sets the @error flag to non-zero, @extended flag may contain the system error code.
@@End@@

###Remarks###
This function opens a search handle and returns information about the first file that the file system finds with
a name that matches the specified pattern. This may or may not be the first file or directory that appears in
a directory-listing application when given the same file name string pattern.

After the search handle is established, you can use it to search for other files that match the same pattern by
using the _WinAPI_FindNextFile() function.

If the function fails because no more matching files can be found, the @extended flag will contain
ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES (18) system error code.

When the search handle is no longer needed, close it by using the _WinAPI_FindClose() function.

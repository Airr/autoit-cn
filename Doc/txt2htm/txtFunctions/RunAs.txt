###Function###
RunAs

###Description###
使用一个不同的用户运行一个外部程序文件.

###Syntax###

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
用户名
	需要使用的用户名.
域名
	用于甄别的域名称.
密码
	用户的密码.
登录标志
	0 - 不加载配置文件的交互式登录.
	1 - 加载配置文件的交互式登录.
	2 - 只是网络认证.
	4 - 继承调用程序的环境变量替换用户的环境变量.
程序
	程序所在的完整路径(文件格式为 EXE,BAT,COM 或 PIF).
工作目录
	[可选参数] 程序工作目录. 如果不指定, 将会被设置为 @SystemDir .这个路径不一定指向程序所在路径.
显示标志
	[可选参数] 执行程序的 "显示" 标志:
	  @SW_HIDE = 隐藏窗口 (或者 Default 关键字)
	  @SW_MINIMIZE = 最小化的窗口
	  @SW_MAXIMIZE = 最大化的窗口
可选标志
	[可选参数] Controls various options related to how the parent and child process interact.
	  0x1 ($STDIN_CHILD)  = Provide a handle to the child's STDIN stream
	  0x2 ($STDOUT_CHILD) = Provide a handle to the child's STDOUT stream
	  0x4 ($STDERR_CHILD) = Provide a handle to the child's STDERR stream
	  0x8 ($STDERR_MERGED) = Provides the same handle for STDOUT and STDERR.  Implies both $STDOUT_CHILD and $STDERR_CHILD.
	  0x10 ($STDIO_INHERIT_PARENT) = Provide the child with the parent's STDIO streams.  This flag can not be combined with any other STDIO flag.  This flag is only useful when the parent is compiled as a Console application.
	  0x10000 ($RUN_CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE) = The child console process should be created with it's own window instead of using the parent's window.  This flag is only useful when the parent is compiled as a Console application.

###Remarks###
Paths with spaces need to be enclosed in quotation marks.

It is important to specify a working directory the user you are running as has access to, otherwise the function will fail.

It is recommended that you only load the user's profile is you are sure you need it.  There is a small chance a profile can be stuck in memory under the right conditions.  If a script using RunAs() happens to be running as the SYSTEM account (for example, if the script is running as a service) and the user's profile is loaded, then you must take care that the script remains running until the child process closes.

When running as an administrator, the Secondary Logon (RunAs) service must be enabled or this function will fail.  This does not apply when running as the SYSTEM account.

After running the requested program the script continues.  To pause execution of the script until the spawned program has finished use the RunAsWait function instead.

Providing the Standard I/O parameter with the proper values permits interaction with the child process through the StderrRead, StdinWrite and StdoutRead functions. Combine the flag values (or use $STDERR_CHILD, $STDIN_CHILD & $STDOUT_CHILD, defined in Constants.au3) to manage more than one stream.

In order for the streams to close, the following conditions must be met: 1) The child process has closed it's end of the stream (this happens when the child closes).  2) AutoIt must read any captured streams until there is no more data.  3) If STDIN is provided for the child, StdinWrite() must be called to close the stream.  Once all streams are detected as no longer needed, all internal resources will automatically be freed.
StdioClose can be used to force the STDIO streams closed.

The "load profile" and "network credentials only" options are incompatible.  Using both will produce undefined results.

There is an issue in the Windows XP generation of Windows which prevents STDIO redirection and the show flag from working.  See Microsoft Knowledge Base article KB818858 for more information about which versions are affected as well as a hotfix for the issue.  User's running Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2 or later, or Windows Vista are not affected.
